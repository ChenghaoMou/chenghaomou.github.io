**Archive the past, and move on.** A fresh start by archiving everything you have right now helps you focus on the goal, not the mess you are in right now. At the end of the day, it is the *creative projects* completed that matters.

For starters:
- Archive your current notes
- Create an inbox folder for future notes
- Follow the [[202204291344|PARA method]]

*When it comes down to organizing them, put index notes in projects first, if possible. This way,2 we put more emphasis on enabling the notes.*
