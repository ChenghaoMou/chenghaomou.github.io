Like exploration phase from [[Algorithms to Live By]]. This is the time where you explore different ideas and take different approaches.

This is also a stage that [[202205011859 Capture|Capture]] and [[202205011901 Organize|Organize]] take place.

## Convergence

This is where you make the decision, on where to go, what to do or how to do it. Much like the exploit phase in [[Algorithms to Live By]] as well. This is the stage where we will produce.

This is when [[202205011902 Distill|Distill]] and [[202205011903 Express|Express]] take place.

2. Fear of cutting options for [[#Convergence]]
