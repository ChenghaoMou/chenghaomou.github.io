## Highlights

- To start a PhD, without insider referral, you need to do work equivariant to half of a PhD. — [Updated on 2021-11-06 14:46:58](https://hyp.is/EXZkPD9LEeyj9A82X40ejA/andreas-madsen.medium.com/becoming-an-independent-researcher-and-getting-published-in-iclr-with-spotlight-c93ef0b39b8b) — Group: #Public

- And as an Independent Researcher, it is reasonable to say that my chances are less than average, simply because I get less feedback. — [Updated on 2021-11-06 14:49:45](https://hyp.is/dOUw_D9LEeyf0485KXgW4w/andreas-madsen.medium.com/becoming-an-independent-researcher-and-getting-published-in-iclr-with-spotlight-c93ef0b39b8b) — Group: #Public

- In the end, we are likely all lazy, and as such, we will be blind to faults in our own work. Just discussing your paper with someone, puts much greater pressure on not taking any unintended shortcuts. — [Updated on 2021-11-06 14:50:14](https://hyp.is/hgIl6D9LEey9d5Ne33b9CA/andreas-madsen.medium.com/becoming-an-independent-researcher-and-getting-published-in-iclr-with-spotlight-c93ef0b39b8b) — Group: #Public

- Write an open-source tool, implement a known paper, etc.. It is helpful to take a break from research, and if your research project fails, you have at least accomplished something. — In my case, having some of these side-projects be recognized by known researchers, was also a great source of encouragement. — [Updated on 2021-11-06 14:50:37](https://hyp.is/k6ja3j9LEeyZimd5OeGh2g/andreas-madsen.medium.com/becoming-an-independent-researcher-and-getting-published-in-iclr-with-spotlight-c93ef0b39b8b) — Group: #Public

- There will be 1–2 messages in a paper, that if misunderstood, will completely confuse the reader and be the first cause of getting rejected. Do not be afraid of repeating a message to prevent that. — [Updated on 2021-11-06 14:51:55](https://hyp.is/wfRzlD9LEeyggCM7JvmGbg/andreas-madsen.medium.com/becoming-an-independent-researcher-and-getting-published-in-iclr-with-spotlight-c93ef0b39b8b) — Group: #Public

- Reviewers are likely to side with already published results. They will only think critical about your submission not previous publications, especially if they come from DeepMind. — [Updated on 2021-11-06 14:54:49](https://hyp.is/KgnV0j9MEey9fF-oPOVV3g/andreas-madsen.medium.com/becoming-an-independent-researcher-and-getting-published-in-iclr-with-spotlight-c93ef0b39b8b) — Group: #Public ^848312
