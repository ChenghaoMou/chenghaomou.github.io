## [[Productivity Masterclass#Pilot 10]]

Set the course, _prioritize_ the tasks on the horizons (preferably in the morning):
1. Calendars and actions ^c2b656
2. Projects ^457f88
3. Areas of focus ^707f08
4. Goals and objectives: to generate projects accordingly ^5df947
5. Long-term visions ^7fd671
6. Purpose and principles ^6996e7

[[#^c2b656]]:
- Schedule tasks into calendar (time-blocking), having default tasks instead of having free time to be wasted
- Use a to-do list:
	- Tackle the highlight or
	- Eat a frog

[[#^457f88]] and [[#^707f08]]:
Project is a group of actionable tasks. So we need to be more precise about that the actions and tasks are.
Don't wait for all the tasks to start the project, tackle them as they come.

Project falls into an area of focus/responsibility.

[[#^5df947]]:
System goals: having a system measured by the mechanism not the output (e.g go the gym 3 times a week)
Progress goals: net positive progression

[[#^7fd671]] and [[#^6996e7]]:
Have a big picture.
