## Take Control of Your Time

Instead of letting others decide what you should do next, prepare your own agenda ahead of the meeting and take the initiative.

Be able to tell why you are doing so and justify the motivation so that people can resonate with you and follow you more easily. Even few words of background story makes a huge difference.
