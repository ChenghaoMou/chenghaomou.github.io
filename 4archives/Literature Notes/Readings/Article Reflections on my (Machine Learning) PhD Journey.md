## Takeaways

1. Focus on the process – learning, research and community participation instead of goals (to publish a paper).
2. If you feel stuck, you can focus on drawing connections on what ideas you have collected.
3. How to stay on top of the progress:
	- Keep a reading list
	- Have a reading strategy
		- Taking notes is important. So that you can discover and revisit ideas later.
	- Expand horizons by reading related areas
	- Curate the sources
	- *But personally, I don't think any human can keep up with the research papers and at best, we are just catching up.*
4. To develop a research vision and grow research maturity
	- Take initiatives
	- Focus on what matters
	- Perseverance. Similar to what James Clear wrote in [[Atomic Habits]] that motivation only gets you started before it wears off, you need some thing else to get you through the process.

> research is fundamentally a community endeavor

If there is a community, chances are that you will get help from it at certain point and you pass on the help in return. I mean, the collaboration is essentially how human society works towards a better place efficiently.
