## Definition

Every time you spend \$$x$ on something, spend the same amount of money on investment.

Coincidently, most minimalists also practice a similar mindset when purchasing something â€” to factor in the expenses of **maintaining and disposing**. Sometimes you can even take into consideration the time and energy you will have to spend for keeping it around. In the end, you end up with a number that is likely 2x or 3x larger than the price tag.
