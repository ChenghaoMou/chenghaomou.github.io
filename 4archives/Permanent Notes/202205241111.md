Style and most tests should be automated (in the commit hooks, CI tools or in a bash script) so you don't have to write a PR comment about this.

One should have a trace of written records regarding design decisions and implementation choices, ranging from technical specifications to your API documentations. Personally, I think questions around directions should not be discussed in a PR, at which time efforts have been invested and it would be too late to make a turn.
