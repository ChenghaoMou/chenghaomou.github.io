**Information Flow**: a flow of *bits* from **sender** to **receiver** with *some probability*.

## Privacy VS. Transparency

- Leaky information flow: aka. privacy violation.
- Inefficient information flow

It is important to recognize the context. Contextualized integrity/privacy frames the line of privacy into various situations. E.g. home images on Google map, various information flows on top of that might cause a lot of issues, even if it is public information in the first place.

### Challenges

Maximizing privacy might lead to transparency issues (e.g. money laundering or buying products without reading any reviews).

**Q**: How should we balance the information flow to minimize transparency dilemma (insufficient information) and privacy dilemma(too much information)?

**A**: To build a Pareto frontier.

### Data is Fire

Data can be useful and dangerous because of duo use.

**If you don't have anything to hide right now, why do you care if someone is inferring**: Changes in life make anything privacy. Implications, correlations and powerful machine learning models can figure out a lot about one's privacy.

Removing PII might not work because of the existence of implicit patterns and information (cross-referencing, pattern recognition).
