## Dilemmas

- AI progress originating from data growth or high quality dataset simply cannot exempt us from violating privacy;
- We need **relative and representative data** in *all research* so that it is applicable in real-life;
	- Not just AI research that is data-hunger because all research collaborates with each other at some point

## Information Services

A typical narrative about privacy:
- Lack of data sharing could lead to service lock-in;
- More privacy violation could happen because of data-sharing;

But there is a difference regarding private data being transferred:
1. Private data moving with the owner;
	1. This is the sharing we want
2. Private data being sold with owner's consent;
	1. This is not the sharing we want

We need **Interoperability** (e.g. install third-party apps on your phone, bypassing ink cartridge in printers) to fight against lock-in. In this case, we need this type of information flow that are in our control.
