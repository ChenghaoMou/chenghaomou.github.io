- Can you tell me more about the team structure at Poolside?
	- How do teams collaborate?
	- Based on the forks on Poolside's Github profile, I know the tech stack includes vLLM, tensorrt, triton, sentencepiece, xformers, gym, something related to k8s for sure, anything else you can share in terms of tech stack?
- What does a typical work day look like at Poolside?
	- What will I be doing if I were to start working today?
