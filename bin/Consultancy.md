Hi Eilidh,

Thanks for reaching out! I am interested in this opportunity. Here are my answers to some of the frequently asked questions:

1. Sponsorship: I do need work permit sponsorship.
2. Work location: Hybrid work is preferred. On-site work will depend on the location.

I am more than happy to have a chat with you if you want to further discuss it. I am also enclosing my schedule as follows just in case.

Would 30 min during any of these times (all in GMT+1) work for you?

- Fri May 10, 09:00 - 11:45 or 15:00 - 16:00
- Mon May 13, 13:00 - 16:00
- Tue May 14, 09:00 - 12:00 or 13:00 - 16:00

You can just let me know or confirm here: https://calendar.notion.so/meet/chenghao/e44z3g5y

Best,

Chenghao
