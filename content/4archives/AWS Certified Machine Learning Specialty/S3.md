Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An _object_ is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A _bucket_ is a container for objects.

## Requirements

- A *bucket* name must be globally unique
- An *object* has a *key* being the full path to that object
- The *maximum* size of an object is **5TB**
- The *maximum number of tags* of an object is **10**

## Features

- S3 is the backbone of many ML services
- It is an ideal candidate for creating a data lake
- It has a centralized architecture
- It supports partitioning for query speedup. For example:
	- by data `s3://bucket/year/month/day/file`
	- by product `s3://bucket/product`

## Tiers

- S3 Standard General Purpose
- S3 Standard Infrequent Access(IA)
- S3 One Zone IA
- S3 Intelligent
- Glacier

## Life Cycle

- Transition actions
	- For example: Standard -> IA
- Expiration actions
	- For example: IA -> Glacier
