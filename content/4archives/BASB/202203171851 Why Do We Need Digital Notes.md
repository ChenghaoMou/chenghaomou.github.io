title: 202203171851 Why Do We Need Digital Notes
updated: 2022-05-06

Digital notes can help in the following areas:

## 1. Building Connections

We all have access to massive information on the internet. What do we do with such information is what sets us apart. Building connections or drawing relationships is a very helpful and powerful action we can take upon such information. Digital notes, being a carrier of such information, makes it very easy to build connections – tagging, linking e.g.

Personally speaking, making connections implicitly means that we need to make efforts visiting notes and actively thinking and even rethinking about those notes. Those tags won't tag themselves.

## 2. We Are Visual Creatures

Some interesting facts in this regard [Humans Are Visual Creatures – Visual Communication of Science • Workshops & Webinars](https://www.seyens.com/humans-are-visual-creatures/)

Digital notes, along with modern note-taking apps, can help us learn visually, reducing the efforts needed to make connections even further. Some interesting features/apps such as:

## 3. Incubating Ideas

Sitting on all the notes and connections, it is most likely you will bump into ideas that feel natural to think about. Just like open-floor offices encourage serendipitous encounters, digital notes encourage revisiting and refactoring and ultimately lead to birth of new ideas.

## 4. Resources

Ideas themselves aren't enough. People have gazillions of ideas every day on earth, few of them really pan out. Digital notes, on one hand, give birth to new ideas through connections, on the other hand, provides data and supplementary information to support your ideas to the end.
