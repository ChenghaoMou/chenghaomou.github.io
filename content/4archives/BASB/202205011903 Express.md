## Return on Attention

Pouring our attention into notes and expressing ourselves is an investment of ourselves and our future. We can simplify this investment as a clean equation:

$$
\frac{\text{Return}}{\text{Attention Invested}}
$$

The $\text{Return}$ in this case can be different forms of our expression, such as blog post or youtube videos.

## Typical Attention Investment Curve

There will be friction in any kind of work nonetheless. We need recognize that and understand that such frictions might contribute to our procrastination. (On how to reduce the friction and inducing more [[Deep Work]] or [[Atomic Habits]])

Any interruptions that happening during the setup phase, it restart the whole process, meaning we have to go through the struggle all over again.

## Intermediate Packets

It refers to the intermediate and *modular* results of your workflow. For example, in the following work session, **4 ~ 7** can be intermediate packets.

1. Research
2. Notes
3. Brainstorms
4. Examples
5. Outlines
6. Prototypes
7. Drafts
8. Last-minute crazy ideas
9. Final deliverables

Such packets, usually refined, can be reused in future projects. (This echos the concept of atomic notes from #productivity/zettelkasten where notes can live and connected simultaneously in multiple places)

By reframing projects into sequential of intermediate packets/tasks, you can marginalize the destructions interruptions can cause.

### How to Create Intermediate Packets

Creating intermediate packets is equal to expressing in this case.

1. Observing, not an expression itself, is the prerequisite for all expressions. e.g. taking notes and consuming ideas.
2. Writing
3. Drawing
4. Acting
5. Producing
6. Selling

## Why Express is Important

[Vico, Giambattista | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/vico/#SSH2c.i)

### The Verum-Factum Principle

> Perhaps the greatest significance of the _Ancient Wisdom_ lies in its presentation of the _verum-factum_ principle. This and the ideal eternal history are Vico’s two most famous ideas. The _verum-factum_ principle holds that <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">one can know the truth in what one makes</mark>. Vico writes, “For the Latins, _verum_ (the true) and _factum_ (what is made) are interchangeable, or to use the customary language of the Schools, they are convertible (_Ancient Wisdom_ 45).”
