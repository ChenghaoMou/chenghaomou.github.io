## Any Form of Summarization is a Future Investment

Highlighting or summarization is about deciding what to forget and what to remember.

## Resonance as Guideline

Same as in the capture guideline [[202205011900 Capture Toolkit#What should we capture]]

## Think About Use-cases

Why do you capture this in the first place? Do you have a use-case for this piece of information? "What dishes can you cook with this ingredient?"
