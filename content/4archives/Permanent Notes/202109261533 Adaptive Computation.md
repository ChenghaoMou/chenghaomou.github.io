# Adaptive Computation

It is a concept that models can perform conditionally computation, primarily based on the input. It is a form of [[202109261532 Machine Learning Optimization]]. See [^1], [^2] and [^3].

Models spend more computation on difficult problems and less on easy problems, or treat those questions in different ways from varying perspectives.

However, it is known for **unstable results** and **sensitivity towards hyper-parameters** e.g. $\tau$ in ACT, especially those controlling **the trade off between computation and accuracy**.[^1]
