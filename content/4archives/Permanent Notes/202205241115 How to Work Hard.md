## Why Work Hard?

We can not change our talents, so work hard is, in most cases, the only choice.

## How to Work Hard?

1. Define your goals and foster disciplines
2. Two mindsets:
	1. Enjoy achievement
	2. Dislike idleness
3. Learn what work is
	1. What matches your talent might not be your interest
	2. Know what is important and interesting
4. Plan ahead
	1. Avoid diminishing returns and burnout
5. Work towards the hard-core center problems
