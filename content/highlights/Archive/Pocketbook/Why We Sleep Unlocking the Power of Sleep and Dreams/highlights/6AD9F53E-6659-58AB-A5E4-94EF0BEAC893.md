text: Moreover, victims of claimed alien abductions frequently report the sense of, or real presence of, a being in the room (the alien). Finally—and this is the key giveaway—the alleged victim frequently describes having been injected with a “paralyzing agent.” Consequently, the victim will describe wanting to fight back, run away, or call out for help but being unable to do so. The offending force is, of course, not aliens, but the persistence of REM-sleep paralysis upon awakening.
