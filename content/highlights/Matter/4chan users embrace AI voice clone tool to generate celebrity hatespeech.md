## Highlights
<mark>To predict how AI voice clones might be used and misused in future, we can look to the recent history of video deepfakes. This technology began to spread online as a way to generate non-consensual pornography, and though many experts worried it would be used for misinformation, this proved to be largely incorrect (so far). Instead, the vast majority of video deepfakes shared online are pornographic, and the software has been used to harass and intimidate not only celebrities but also private individuals. At the same time, deepfakes are being slowly embraced by commercial entities and being used alongside traditional VFX techniques in film and TV.</mark>
