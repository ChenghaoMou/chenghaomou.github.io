## Highlights
<mark>The intensely personal nature of a conversation — compared with a classic Internet search — might help to sway perceptions of search results. People might inherently trust the answers from a chatbot that engages in conversation more than those from a detached search engine, says Aleksandra Urman, a computational social scientist at the University of Zurich in Switzerland.</mark>

<mark>By contrast, it’s rarely known what data an LLM trained on — is it Encyclopaedia Britannica or a gossip blog? “It’s completely untransparent how [AI-powered search] is going to work, which might have major implications if the language model misfires, hallucinates or spreads misinformation,” says Urman. If search bots make enough errors, then, rather than increasing trust with their conversational ability, they have the potential to instead unseat users' perceptions of search engines as impartial arbiters of truth, Urman says.</mark>
