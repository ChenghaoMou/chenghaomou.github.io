## Highlights
<mark>As we dug into this it became clear most of of these new ChatGPT users were tying to use our geocoding API for an entirely different purpose. It seems ChatGPT is wrongly recommending us for “reverse phone number lookup” - ie the ability to determine the location of a mobile phone solely based on the number. This is not a service we provide. It is not a service we have ever provided, nor a service we have any plans to provide. Indeed, it is a not a service we are technically capable of providing. And yet ChatGPT has absolutely no problem recommending us for this service (complete with python code you can cut and paste) as you can see in this screenshot.</mark>

<mark>The key difference is that humans have learned to be sceptical when getting advice from other humans, for example via a video coding tutorial. It seems though that we haven’t yet fully internalized this when it comes to AI in general or ChatGPT specifically. The other key difference is the sheer scale of the problem. Bad tutorial videos got us a handful of frustrated sign-ups. With ChatGPT the problem is several orders of magnitude bigger.</mark>

<mark>ChatGPT is doing exactly what it’s makers intended - producing a coherent, believable answer. Whether that answer is truthful does not seem to matter in the slightest.</mark>
