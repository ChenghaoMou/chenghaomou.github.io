## Highlights
<mark>The problem is that making something easy has a dark side, because whatever was hard to do is not going to be done at all anymore. In specific, Google eliminated the need to connect with communities online if all you wanted was the knowledge produced by that community. And connecting with people and communities – in the style we still practiced in the 90s – is time consuming, often hard.</mark>

<mark>The problem with the information paradigm is how “information” is ripped out of its context: the people, the inherited knowledge, the culture that produced it. Everything is seen as an atomic digestible, and there is little regard for the processes, conversations, debates that produced those digestibles. The whole idea of “information” is somewhat of a farce, I doubt you can truly learn and internalize some information without learning surrounding information that sheds light on the nuances involved. These are things that only knowledgeable people can distinguish and report on. But it is legitimately hard to know who is an expert in what, since – thanks to Google – we all have access to atomic digestibles from any community of experts, and can easily copy-paste them whenever needed in a discussion (with whom? Probably randos on social media).</mark>
