## Highlights
<mark>That sounds pretty important, but people remain hyper-fixated on the Altmans and OpenAIs of the world. The entire world seems to be completely zeroed in solely on generative AI, or machine learning systems that can create content when prompted (e.g. chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard, or image generators like Midjourney or DALL-E). And in doing so, we might be missing out on the actual dangers of AI—and opening ourselves up to a lot of harm in the process.</mark>

<mark>While Altman has said he welcomes regulation to rein in generative AI, the company’s refusal to be more transparent about the dataset used to train ChatGPT’s and shutting down requests to up access for third party apps to use its API suggest OpenAI isn’t as warm to regulation as it claims. “His company is the one that put this out there,” Venkatasubramanian said. “He doesn't get to opine on the dangers of AI. Let's not pretend that he's the person we should be listening to on how to regulate.” He added, “We don't ask arsonists to be in charge of the fire department.”</mark>
