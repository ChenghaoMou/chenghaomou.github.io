## Highlights
<mark>Neurologists are usually primarily concerned with thinking about the hardware of the brain, where you can see that some part of the brain is broken, either with imaging studies, or with pathology under a microscope, or EEG — a study that looks at brainwave activity. We’re sort of more concerned with low-level brain problems. Psychiatry and psychology usually approach the brain from the standpoint of the mind — not what’s happening with the physical substrate of the brain but what is happening in people’s thought processes, and what sort of dysfunction is there in thought processes. Now, obviously, there’s overlap between the two.</mark>

<mark>That overlap, in some ways, is still not totally well understood. It can come out in different ways. If you think about depression, say, certain brain structures are implicated in depression. There are neurotransmitters that are implicated in depression. There’s certainly cases of depression where treating with a particular medication that addresses a neurotransmitter will improve a person’s depression or help get rid of the problem.</mark>

<mark>So as you get older, as you get experience, the brain prunes down to the connections that are most beneficial.</mark>

<mark>It does level off. And we’re not talking about getting rid of the neurons, either. We’re just talking about getting rid of some of the connections between different neurons. So by and large, the number of neurons stays about the same.</mark>

<mark>You may also wish to read: A neurosurgeon on why some people function with only half a brain. The study results are reassuring and they point to two larger truths. First, the mind is not the brain and second, people tend to see the mind–brain relationship in terms of the cultural conceptions that matter to them.</mark>
