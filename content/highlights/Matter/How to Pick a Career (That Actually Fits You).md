title: "How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)"
---

## Highlights
<mark>Kids in school are kind of like employees of a company where someone else is the CEO. But no one is the CEO of your life in the real world, or of your career path---except you. And you've spent your whole life becoming a pro student, leaving you with zero experience as the CEO of anything. Up to now, you've only been in charge of the micro decisions---"How do I succeed at my job as a student?"---and now you're suddenly holding the keys to the macro cockpit as well, tasked with answering stressful macro questions like "Who am I?" and "What are the important things in life?" and "What are my options for paths and which one should I choose and how do I even make a path?" When we leave school for the last time, the macro guidance we've become so accustomed to is suddenly whisked away from us, leaving us standing there holding our respective dicks, with no idea how to do this.</mark>

<mark>I think a lot of those regrets stem from the fact that most of us aren't really taught about path-making in our childhoods, and most of us also don't get much better at path-making as adults, which leaves many people looking back on a life path that didn't really make sense, given who they are and the world they lived in.</mark>

<mark>So a typical career will take up somewhere between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult time---not something to be a cook about.</mark>

<mark>All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future---but the kind of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy. Whatever shape your career path ends up taking, the world will be altered by it.</mark>

<mark>but the way many societies are right now, a person's career quadruples as the person's primary identity.</mark>

<mark>The part of the tentacle that just wants to sit around and relax will hold you back from sweating to build the kind of career that offers long-term flexibility and the kind of wealth that can make life luxurious and cushy and full of toys. The part of the tentacle that only feels comfortable when the future feels predictable will reject the exact kinds of paths that may generate the long-term freedom another part of the tentacle longs for. The side of you that wants a stress-free life doesn't get along very well with the side of you that thirsts to be hang gliding off a cliff in Namibia like Richard Branson.</mark>

<mark>So that's the situation. You've got this Yearning Octopus in your head with five tentacles (or however many yours has), each with their own agenda, that often conflict with each other. Then there are the distinct individual yearnings on each tentacle, often in conflict amongst themselves. And if that weren't enough, you sometimes have furious internal conflict inside a single yearning. Like when your desire to pursue your passion can't figure out what it's most passionate about.</mark>

<mark>Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise.</mark>

<mark>Do you treat the words of your external influences as information, held and considered by an authentic inner you, that you've carefully decided to embrace? Or are your influences themselves actually in your brain, masquerading as inner you? Do you want the same thing someone else you know wants because you heard them talk about it, you thought about it alongside your own life experience, and you eventually decided that, for now, you agree? Or because you heard someone talk about what they want or fear, and you thought, "I don't know shit and that person does, so if they say X is true, I'm sure they're right"---and then you etched those ideas into your mind, never again feeling the need to question them?</mark>

<mark>You may like to think a desire to do something bold is high up on your hierarchy, but if you're not currently working on something bold, it reveals that however important boldness is to you, something else---some source of fear or inertia in you---is currently being prioritized above it.</mark>

<mark>If you flip over your desire for self-actualization, you'll see a fear of underachieving. The other half of your craving of self-esteem is a fear of feeling shame. If your actions don't seem to match what you believe is the internal hierarchy of your yearnings, usually it's because you're forgetting to think about the role your fears are playing. What looks like a determined drive for success, for example, might actually be someone running away from a negative self-image or trying to escape feelings like envy or under-appreciation. If your actions seem beholden to yearnings that you don't believe you actually care that much about, you're probably not looking closely enough at your fears.</mark> ^28fcb5

<mark>Hypothesis testing is intuitive in the dating world. If a friend were toiling over what kind of person she wants to marry but never went out with anyone, you'd tell her, "You can't figure this out on your couch---you've gotta start going on dates, and that'll teach you what you want in a partner." If that friend then went on a solid first date and returned home to toil for hours about whether or not this new person was The One, you'd again have to correct her. You'd say, "There's no way you can know that from just one date! You have to get some experience dating this person to learn what you need to learn to make that decision."</mark>

<mark>Reframing your next major career decision as a far lower-stakes choice makes the number of options exciting, not stressful.</mark>

<mark>The whining octopus is a reminder of why pure, elated happiness is never a reasonable goal. The times you feel pure happiness are temporary, drug-induced delusions---like the honeymoon phase of a new relationship or new job or the high following a long-awaited success. Those moments are the perfect golf shots of a mediocre golfer's outing---they're awesome, and you should enjoy the shit out of them---but they're not the new normal, and they never will be.</mark> ^47ecd7

<mark>Chasing happiness is an amateur move. Feeling contentment in those times when your choices and your circumstances have combined to pull it off, and knowing you have all that you could ever ask for, is for the wise.</mark> ^d61a26

<mark>The insecurity of humility doesn't feel very good, and the burden of having to continually invent your own life map is never easy---but insecurity and difficulty are the feelings of driving your own ship.</mark> ^d6d23e
