## Highlights
<mark>“A brand is a person’s gut feeling about a product, service, or company. It’s a GUT FEELING because we are all emotional, intuitive beings, despite our best efforts to be rational. It’s a PERSON’S gut feeling, because in the end brand is defined by individuals, not by companies, markets, or the so-called general public… When enough individuals arrive at the same gut feeling, a company can be said to have a brand.”</mark>
