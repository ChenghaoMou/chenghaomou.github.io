title: "What Students Lose by Embracing Easy Tech Like ChatGPT"
---

## Highlights
<mark>Dr. Anthony Bradley of The King’s College tweeted this a few days ago, Students are writing papers using AI. Colleges are scrambling to combat it. We should also talk about moral issues: what type of moral values does a student have who would use AI to produce a paper, and turn it in as their own work, without their conscience being seared?”</mark>

<mark>When you get email, you lose the personal touch of a handwritten letter. When you get cell phones, you lose a chunk of in person communication. When you get Google Maps, you lose the freedom to get to Wal-Mart by yourself. If all this tech were to get stripped away, many of us would be reduced to helpless infants! When you get AI and ChatGPT, you don’t only lose the capacity to memorize, but to articulate, argue, express, and think. It also offers students a shortcut that bypasses honesty and maturity.</mark>

<mark>Do you want to be the kind of person who depends so much on AI that you can’t think for yourself? What’s the point of a college education if a bot does your homework for you? And how will these choices affect your future habits as a spouse, employee, boss, and friend?</mark>

<mark>Honesty matters in academia, largely because academic conduct says a lot about character and who a person will grow into over time. Handing yourself over to technological ease might feel like power and progress, but it is weakening minds and diminishing freedom—freedom to be the kind of people who can learn, know, and love without the aid of the machine.</mark>
