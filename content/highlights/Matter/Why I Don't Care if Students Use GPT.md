## Highlights
<mark>First of all, I agree with those who claim that bans and regulations are not effective. There is no point in starting an arms race between students, professors, cheating-detectors, cheating-detector-circumventors, digital watermarking, watermark-erasers, and so forth.</mark>

<mark>Instead, I propose a radical approach: Teachers shouldn't worry very much about algorithms that can write, and instead spend a significant amount of time explaining to students why they do not actually want to use GPT to write their essay for them. One reason is that there are many ethical issues with large language models.</mark>

<mark>In fact, they are guests in an academic version of WestWorld. Every semester, I spend part of my last lecture letting students in on the secret that we professors are nothing more than very realistic looking robots who pretend to need them to solve problems we secretly already have the solution for. We pose questions and ask for their best work, but in reality already have the answers and have done the work ourselves. And the whole thing is constructed in semester-long narrative arcs that do a complete scene-reset once the quests are completed, and a new train full of guests arrive at the same exact narrative point where the last one was a year ago.</mark>

<mark>The answer is perhaps obvious: learning. Amidst the daily discussion about assignments, projects, grades, and credits, students can easily forget that the only useful outcome of all the hard work that goes into a semester (theirs and ours) is knowledge gained by students. At WestWorld, guests really feel like they are solving life-or-death problems. In reality, they are merely collecting high-end vacation experiences. Similarly, and this is hard to remember when you are stuck on a problem set: You are not trying to solve a differential equation; you are trying to learn.</mark>

<mark>But anyone who writes for a living knows that in many ways writing is thinking. The process of translating vague ideas into a coherent text helps structure ideas and make connections. The time spent editing and re-editing weeds out important ideas from marginal ones. The effort to address an imaginary reader, to clarify things to them, helps eliminate unnecessary style decisions. Finding your own voice helps you understand yourself and your contribution to the world better. Letting an AI system do this work for you means giving up all of that. It's like sending a robot to do your WestWorld vacation for you, and just sharing the photos it took on your Instagram feed. Behaving in this way is not at all about cheating, it is about missing the whole point. If you care about having clear ideas and becoming better at what you do, you want to be writing.</mark>

<mark>Our role as educators is to remind our students of WestWorld; ask them to step out of the client-supplier narrative; remind them that they are doing this only for themselves and that even if you have the best job in the world, it won't make you feel accomplished and won't give you the same satisfaction as being able to have clear thoughts, ideas, and opinions. And at the end of the day you still have to go to sleep with your own thoughts, ideas, and opinions. Unless, of course, you fall asleep in the Metaverse.</mark>
