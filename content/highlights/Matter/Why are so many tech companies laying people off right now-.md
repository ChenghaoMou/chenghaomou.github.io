## Highlights
<mark>The literature on whether layoffs actually work to boost stock price is mixed: in one study, companies that closed plants and did layoffs had better returns than companies that only did layoffs. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, layoffs had no effect on stock prices at all. Layoffs do have one concrete impact. Pfeffer’s research has found that layoffs literally kill people — by increasing the risk that someone will die by suicide and by levering up stress, both among people laid off and among those who remain. Layoffs may also reduce productivity among those who remain employed. So why do layoffs at all if they don’t actually work? “People do all kinds of stupid things all the time,” Pfeffer says. “I don’t know why you’d expect managers to be any different.”</mark>
