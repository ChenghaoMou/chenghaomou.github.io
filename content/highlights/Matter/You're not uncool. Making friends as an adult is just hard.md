<mark>“Researchers also find that when we develop groups, our friendships are more sustainable than they are with individuals. Because there's multiple touch points now, right? Someone else in the group could reach out to all of us, and then we all keep in touch,” she notes. If that sounds terrifying to you, Franco says it’s crucial to assume that people already like you. Assume any meet ups will go well, she says, which in turn will help build up your confidence.</mark>
<mark>“You're on your phone, you're waiting for people to come to you, you're not introducing yourself to people,” she says. “It's not just that you have to attend that event, but you have to overcome covert avoidance by engaging with people when you get there.” It’s essential to take the extra step and ask for contact information.</mark>

<mark>“If you are in a place of loneliness, you are, according to the research, more likely to assume people are going to reject you,” Franco explains. “You're just sort of hyper vigilant for rejection and social threats. You're more likely to think that social interactions will be more negative and less enjoyable.” That’s why she says it’s of the utmost importance for people like Troxel to keep putting themselves out there.</mark>
