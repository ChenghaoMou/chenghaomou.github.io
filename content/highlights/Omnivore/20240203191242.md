## Highlights

> If all of the groups had neglected to make their data and code available, this data-leakage problem would have been almost impossible to catch. That would be a problem not just for the studies that were already published, but also for every other scientist who might want to use that data set for their own work.

> More insidiously, the erroneously high performance reported in these papers could dissuade others from attempting to improve on the published methods, because they would incorrectly find their own algorithms lacking by comparison. Equally troubling, it could also complicate journal publication, because demonstrating improvement is often a requirement for successful review — potentially holding back research for years.
