## Highlights

> While the tools might be available to a large number of people at a convenient cost, and with open-source models, you might even download them onto your computer and run them, it implicitly assumes that you have the spare change to afford using these technologies. The sharing of power also implies sharing the profits, and as many have argued, there is a brief period where productivity increases, but over time, those most affected are not the companies. People who cannot adopt the technology will struggle to keep up, may face job losses, and those who can use the technology may make each other redundant or be expected to surpass the baseline outputs provided by these technologies.
