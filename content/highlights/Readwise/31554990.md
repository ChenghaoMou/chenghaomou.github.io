## Highlights
> This is about getting mighty clear about what makes you happy and what makes you feel the most alive, and then creating it instead of pretending you can’t have it. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=100))

> It’s about having the cojones to show up as the brightest, happiest, badassiest version of yourself, whatever that looks like to you. ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=103))

> You need to go from wanting to change your life to deciding to change your life. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=105))

> Deciding means jumping in all the way, doing whatever it takes, and going after your dreams with the tenacity of a dateless cheerleader a week before prom night. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=108))

> If you want to live a life you’ve never lived, you have to do things you’ve never done. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=153))

> Our subconscious mind contains the blueprint for our lives. It’s running the show based on the unfiltered information it gathered when we were kids, otherwise known as our “beliefs.” ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=247))

> 2) We are, for the most part, completely oblivious to these subconscious beliefs that run our lives. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=249))

> 3) When our conscious minds finally develop and show up for work, no matter how big and smart and highfalutin they grow to be, they’re still being controlled by the beliefs we’re carrying around in our subconscious minds. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=251))

> The trick is to have both parts—energy and action—working in unison: unless your energy is lined up properly with that which you desire, really desire, any action you take is going to require way more effort to get you where you want to go, if it gets you there at all. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=382))

> It never ceases to amaze me the precious time we spend chasing the squirrels around our brains, playing out our dramas, worrying about unwanted facial hair, seeking adoration, justifying our actions, complaining about slow Internet connections, dissecting the lives of idiots, when we are sitting in the middle of a full-blown miracle that is happening right here, right now. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=420))

> You get to choose how you perceive your reality. So why, when it comes to perceiving yourself, would you choose to see anything other than a super huge rock star of a creature? ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=591))

> We’re all busy, but it’s the people who make enjoying their lives a priority who, um, enjoy their lives. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=678))

> Holding on to my bad feelings about this is doing nothing but harming me, and everyone else, and preventing me from enjoying my life fully. I am an awesome person. I choose to enjoy my life.

> It still ultimately comes down to what’s true for you, however, so the more connected to your inner truth you are, the easier it will be to use outside opinions to your advantage, rather than let them rule your life. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=863))

> Imagine that you’re an alien floating around in outer space and you suddenly swoop down to Earth and inhabit your own body. As the alien, everything about this life is new to you. You look around—what do you see? What is this person who you’ve inhabited so obviously awesome at? What do they have the most fun doing? What connections do they have? What resources and opportunities are available to them? ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=903))

> Much of the time we pretend we aren’t clear on what our calling is when what’s really going on is that we’re horrified to face it because it seems too big or too impossible to make a living at or completely out of the question for us.
