## Highlights
> To build wealth it didn’t matter when you bought U.S. stocks, just that you bought them and kept buying them. It didn’t matter if valuations were high or low. It didn’t matter if you were in a bull market or a bear market. All that mattered was that you kept buying. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=105))

> Make it a habit to invest your money like you make it a habit to pay your rent or mortgage. Buy investments like you buy food—do it often. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=114))

> If you don’t have much money invested, then you should focus on increasing your savings (and investing it). However, if you already have a sizable portfolio, then you should spend more time thinking about the details of your investment plan. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=176))

> First, figure out how much you expect to comfortably save in the next year. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=187))

> Next, determine how much you expect your investments to grow in the next year (in ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=190))

> If your expected savings are higher, then you need to focus more on saving money and adding to your investments. However, if your expected investment growth is higher, then spend more time thinking about how to invest what you already have. If the numbers are close to each other, then you should spend time on both. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=194))

> When we have the ability to save more, we should save more—and when we don’t, we should ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=262))

> save less. We shouldn’t use static, unchanging rules because our finances are rarely static and unchanging. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=262))

> This is why the best savings advice is: save what you can. If you follow this advice, you will experience far less stress and far more overall happiness. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=267))

> “The negative effects of stress outweigh the positive effects of income or health in general.” ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=277))

> This implies that saving more is only beneficial if you can do it in a stress-free way. Otherwise, you will likely do yourself more harm than good. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=280))

> Similar to the effect of exercise on weight loss, cutting spending seems to have inherent limitations when it comes to saving more money. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=418))

> Increases in income aren’t followed by similar increases in spending. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=446))

> diminishing marginal utility. This is a jargonistic phrase, but its meaning is simple. It means that each additional unit of consumption brings about less benefit than the unit before it. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=456))

> Their paper clearly illustrates that many poor people stay poor not because of their talent/motivation, but because they are in low-paying jobs that they must work to survive. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=493))

> The most consistent way to get rich is to grow your income and invest in income-producing assets. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=510))

> If you want to save more, the main point is to tighten up where you can, then focus on increasing your income. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=513))

> Therefore, if you need to make more money, consider selling more of your time, or your expertise. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=529))

> The only downside to selling your time is that it doesn’t scale. One hour of work will always equal one hour of income. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=532))

> Unfortunately, similar to selling your time, selling an individual skill or service doesn’t scale. You have to do the work for each service delivered. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=546))

> While a 9 to 5 will rarely make you filthy rich, learning how to work well with people and developing your skills can be one of the best things for your career development. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=591))

> Yes, selling your time, skills, or products is great and all, but it shouldn’t be the end goal of your wealth-building journey. The end goal should be ownership—using your additional income to acquire more income-producing assets. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=613))

> Ultimately, you are the one that must figure out what you want out of life. Once you do, then spend your money accordingly. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=756))

> Lifestyle creep is when someone increases their spending after experiencing an increase in income or as a way of keeping up with their peers. ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=789))

> How much lifestyle creep can you afford? Technically it varies based on your savings rate, but for most people the answer is around 50%. ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=799))

> More importantly, saving 50% of your raises is easy to implement and remember. Half is for you and half is for future you (in retirement). Coincidentally, this idea is similar to The 2x Rule I wrote about in the prior chapter when discussing how to spend money without feeling guilty. ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=892))

> This will be roughly equivalent to a 40-year payment stream discount by 4% per year. I prefer this shortcut because you can now do the math in your head. Therefore, a $800,000 increase in lifetime earnings over 40 years is worth about $400,000 today. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1000))

> Work defines who you are. It provides a place where you are social with people. It gives you interaction with people all day long in an interesting way. It even helps you live longer and is very, very good for brain health… ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1525))

> As a result, investing is the only way in which you can fight back against the march of time and turn your diminishing human capital into productive financial capital. Financial capital that will pay you long into the future. ([Location 1671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1671))

> your human capital is a dwindling asset. Each year you work reduces the present value of your human capital because you have one less year of future earnings. ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1691))

> As a result, the only way to guarantee that you will have some income in the future (outside of government-sponsored income) is to build up financial capital. ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1692))

> Pros: High historic returns. Easy to own and trade. Low maintenance (someone else runs the business). ([Location 1796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1796))

> Cons: High volatility. Valuations can change quickly based on sentiment rather than fundamentals. ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1797))

> Bonds should act as a diversifying asset, not a risk asset. ([Location 1821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1821))

> During market sell-offs, bonds are one of the only assets that tend to rise while everything else is falling. ([Location 1829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1829))

> Pros: Lower volatility. Good for rebalancing. Safety of principal. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1860))

> Cons: Low returns, especially after inflation. Not great for income in a low-yield environment. ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1861))

> Despite the many financial upsides to owning an investment property, it also requires far more work than many other assets that you can set and forget. ([Location 1878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1878))

> However, when things go wrong, like they did in 2020 with pandemic-induced travel restrictions, they can go really wrong. As many Airbnb entrepreneurs learned the hard way, investment properties aren’t always so easy. ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1883))

> buying individual investment properties is similar to buying individual stocks in that they aren’t diversified. When you buy an investment property you take on all the specific risks to that property. ([Location 1886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1886))

> Pros: Higher returns than other more traditional asset classes, especially when using leverage. ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1898))

> Cons: Managing the property and tenants can be a headache. Hard to diversify. ([Location 1899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1899))

> However, like most other risky assets, publicly traded REITs tend to sell off during stock market crashes. Therefore, don’t expect diversification benefits from REITs on the downside. ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1929))

> Pros: Real estate exposure that you don’t have to manage. Less correlated with stocks during good times. ([Location 1937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1937))

> Cons: Volatility greater than or equal to stocks. Less liquidity for non-traded REITs. Highly correlated with stocks and other risk assets during stock market crashes. ([Location 1939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1939))

> Pros: Uncorrelated to traditional financial assets. Generally steady income. Cons: High seller fees. Tastes can change unexpectedly and impact income. ([Location 2044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2044))

> The hard part about products as investments is that they require lots of work upfront with no guarantee of a payout. There is a long road to monetization. ([Location 2056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2056))

> Pros: Full ownership. Personal satisfaction. Can create a valuable brand. Cons: Very labor intensive. No guarantee of payoff. ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2068))

> Gold, cryptocurrency, commodities, art, and wine have no reliable income stream associated with their ownership, so I have not included them in my list of income-producing assets. ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2073))

> Nevertheless, Darren’s story is a microcosm of what it’s like to be a stock picker. The mental turmoil. The fear of missing out. The elation, triumph, pain, and regret.

> As a result, the best market timing approach is to invest your money as soon as you can. This isn’t just an opinion of mine either. It is backed by historical data across multiple asset classes and multiple time periods. ([Location 2369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2369))

> As you can see, Average-In underperformed Buy Now by 2%-4%, on average, over 12 months for most assets and in 60%–80% of all starting months. ([Location 2437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2437))

> As the next chart illustrates, the standard deviation of the Buy Now strategy is always higher than the Average-In strategy when investing in the S&P 500. ([Location 2444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2444))

> The problem is that severe market declines don’t happen too often. In U.S. market history severe dips have only taken place in the 1930s, 1970s, and 2000s. That’s rare. This means that Buy the Dip only has a small chance of beating DCA. ([Location 2579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2579))

> Because while you wait for your beloved dip, you may find that it never comes. As a result, you end up missing out on months (or more) of compound growth as the market keeps rising and leaves you behind. ([Location 2646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2646))

> You should invest as soon and as often as you can. ([Location 2656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2656))

> The only good news here is that, over 30-year periods, the differences in annualized returns are far less pronounced. ([Location 2727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2727))

> As a result, the importance of your future returns increases as you add more money. This means that, after adding funds, a negative return will cost you more in absolute dollar terms than if that negative return had occurred before you added those funds. ([Location 2749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2749))

> And since most individual investors add assets over time, the ordering of investment returns matters more than almost any other financial risk you will face. ([Location 2752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2752))

> Getting the negative returns later in life (when you have the most money in play) leaves you far worse off than if you experienced those negative returns when you first started investing. In other words, the end is everything. ([Location 2766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2766))

> Consider working part-time to supplement your income. ([Location 2801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2801))

> And if you are a younger investor, the best way to mitigate bad luck is time itself. Since most markets go up most of the time, as we saw in chapter 13, this means that time is a young investor’s friend. ([Location 2805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2805))

> Smith’s story illustrates an important lesson about risk and the cost of inaction — sometimes the biggest risk you can take is taking no risk at all. ([Location 2833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2833))

> We have the ability to diversify. We can diversify what assets we own and we can diversify when we own them. Buying a diverse set of income-producing assets over time is one of the best ways to combat volatility when it rears its ugly head. ([Location 2906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2906))

> But it wasn’t audacious. It was a moment of normalcy. If the flower guy still has hope, why shouldn’t I? ([Location 2937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2937))

> The reasoning is simple—every dollar invested during the crash will grow to far more than one invested in months prior, assuming that the market eventually recovers. ([Location 2952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2952))

> It comes from a simple mathematical fact—every percentage loss requires an even larger percentage gain to get back to even. ([Location 2963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2963))

> But we can’t invest based on exceptions or what might happen. Otherwise, we would never invest at all. ([Location 3055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3055))

> As Friedrich Neitzsche once said, “Ignore the past and you will lose an eye. Live in the past and you will lose both.” Knowing history is important, but obsessing over it can lead us astray. This is why we must invest based on what the data tells us. ([Location 3056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3056))

> Because selling forces you to face off against two of the strongest behavioral biases in the investment world—fear of missing out on the upside and the fear of losing money on the downside. ([Location 3073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3073))

> To rebalance. To get out of a concentrated (or losing) position. To meet your financial needs. ([Location 3080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3080))

> Since markets tend to go up over time, the optimal thing to do is to sell as late as possible. Therefore, selling over time (or as late as possible) is usually better than selling right away. ([Location 3090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3090))

> From this simple fact we can then infer that the portfolio that never rebalances generally outperforms the one that rebalances annually. Why? Because nearly every time you rebalance you usually end up selling a higher-growth asset (stocks) to buy a lower-growth asset (bonds). ([Location 3121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3121))

> To reduce risk. Rebalancing is all about controlling risk. ([Location 3130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3130))

> From this plot we can see that, most of the time, rebalancing reduces risk by shifting money from your higher-volatility assets (stocks) to your lower-volatility assets (bonds). ([Location 3144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3144))

> Unfortunately, no rebalancing frequency consistently outperformed all the others. ([Location 3152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3152))

> “The risk-adjusted returns are not meaningfully different whether a portfolio is rebalanced monthly, quarterly, or annually; however, the number of rebalancing events and resulting costs increase significantly.”95 ([Location 3154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3154))

> All of these analyses illustrate the same thing—it doesn’t matter when you rebalance, just that you do it on some periodic basis. As a result, I recommend an annual rebalance for two reasons: It takes less time. It coincides with our annual tax season. ([Location 3161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3161))

> Whatever you decide to do when it comes to rebalancing frequency, avoiding unnecessary taxation is a must. This is why I don’t recommend rebalancing frequently in your taxable accounts (i.e., brokerage account). Because every time you do, you have to pay Uncle Sam. ([Location 3173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3173))

> While selling an asset to rebalance isn’t the worst thing in the world, there is a way to rebalance your portfolio that involves no tax consequences at all—Just Keep Buying. That’s right. You can buy your way back into a rebalanced portfolio. I call this an accumulation rebalance because you are rebalancing by buying your most underweight asset over time. ([Location 3178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3178))

> Sometimes it’s better to trade maybes for certainties. ([Location 3208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3208))

> If you sell it all right away and it goes up 10x, you will feel far worse than if you sell 95% of it and the remaining 5% goes to $0. It’s this regret minimization framework that you should employ when deciding on how much to sell. ([Location 3214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3214))

> And don’t mix up a period of underperformance with a losing position. Every asset class goes through periods of underperformance, so you shouldn’t use these periods as an excuse to sell. ([Location 3229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3229))

> As a reminder, a 401(k)—also called a traditional 401(k)—is funded with pre-tax money while a Roth 401(k) is funded with post-tax money. The only difference between these account types is when you decide to pay your taxes. ([Location 3299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3299))

> Will your effective income tax rate be higher now (while working) or later (in retirement)? All else equal, if you think your income taxes will be higher now, then contribute to a traditional 401(k), otherwise contribute to a Roth 401(k). ([Location 3327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3327))

> Though there are a few scenarios where a Roth 401(k) would be preferred to a traditional 401(k), I generally prefer the traditional 401(k). Why? Because it has one thing that a Roth doesn’t have—optionality. ([Location 3354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3354))

> This is why it probably doesn’t make sense to contribute to a Roth 401(k) while living in a high tax area like New York City, unless you know you are going to retire in an area with similarly high taxes. ([Location 3367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3367))

> Despite the lack of optionality in a Roth 401(k), there are a few special cases where a Roth might be the way to go. One of these cases is for people who are high savers. ([Location 3379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3379))

> This simple example demonstrates that the Roth 401(k) is probably the better choice for high savers, as you get more total tax-deferred benefits. ([Location 3389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3389))

> I ask this question because I feel like I made a financial mistake by contributing too much to my 401(k) when I was younger. While my retirement projections look great now, I also placed some limits on what I can do with my money. ([Location 3479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3479))

> Ultimately, the decision to max out your 401(k) will be dependent on your individual circumstances. Factors such as your temperament, financial goals, and the cost of your employer’s 401(k) plan will all play a role in this decision. Make sure you have considered these factors carefully before moving forward. ([Location 3493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3493))

> In fact, if you want to maximize your after-tax wealth, then you should put your highest-growth assets in tax-sheltered accounts (e.g., 401k, IRA, etc.) and your lowest-growth assets in taxable accounts. ([Location 3507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3507))

> This example illustrates why you need to consider the expected growth rate of your assets in addition to the tax rates on income/capital gains before making an asset location decision. Additionally, by placing your high-growth (and likely higher-risk) assets into a nontaxable account, you may be less tempted to sell them during a market crash because they are harder to access. ([Location 3516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3516))

> So, when the market crashes, the assets that are most likely to maintain their value are the ones that are also most accessible. ([Location 3522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3522))

> There is no right answer, because being rich is a relative concept. Always has been and always will be. And that relativity will be present throughout your life. ([Location 3656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3656))

> in some circumstances, time is worth far more than money. Because you can do some things with time that you could never do with money. In fact, with enough time you could even move mountains. ([Location 3694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3694))

> This is why time is, and always will be, your most important asset. How you use that time in your 20s, 30s, and 40s will have huge impacts on your life in your 50s, 60s, and 70s. Unfortunately, it can take a while to learn this lesson. I know from personal experience. ([Location 3713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3713))

> But you know what would have made a difference? Making better decisions earlier in my career. It wasn’t my money I should have optimized, but my time. ([Location 3733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3733))

> The reason for my mistake is that I incorrectly believed that money was a more important asset than time. I only later realized why this was false. Though you can always earn more money, nothing can buy you more time. ([Location 3745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3745))

> “Young people consistently overestimate their future life satisfaction. They make a whopping forecasting error, as nonrandom as it could be—as if you lived in Seattle and expected sunshine every day… Young adults in their twenties overestimate their future life satisfaction by about 10 percent on average. Over time, however, excessive optimism diminishes… People are not becoming depressed. They are becoming, well, realistic.”108 ([Location 3772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3772))

> Growth stocks are priced similarly to how we think of ourselves when we are young. There are high expectations and high hopes for the future. However, many of us, like many growth stocks, eventually fail to meet these high expectations. ([Location 3783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3783))

# Just Keep Buying

## Highlights
> To build wealth it didn’t matter when you bought U.S. stocks, just that you bought them and kept buying them. It didn’t matter if valuations were high or low. It didn’t matter if you were in a bull market or a bear market. All that mattered was that you kept buying. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=105))

> Make it a habit to invest your money like you make it a habit to pay your rent or mortgage. Buy investments like you buy food—do it often. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=114))

> If you don’t have much money invested, then you should focus on increasing your savings (and investing it). However, if you already have a sizable portfolio, then you should spend more time thinking about the details of your investment plan. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=176))

> First, figure out how much you expect to comfortably save in the next year. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=187))

> Next, determine how much you expect your investments to grow in the next year (in ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=190))

> If your expected savings are higher, then you need to focus more on saving money and adding to your investments. However, if your expected investment growth is higher, then spend more time thinking about how to invest what you already have. If the numbers are close to each other, then you should spend time on both. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=194))

> When we have the ability to save more, we should save more—and when we don’t, we should ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=262))

> save less. We shouldn’t use static, unchanging rules because our finances are rarely static and unchanging. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=262))

> This is why the best savings advice is: save what you can. If you follow this advice, you will experience far less stress and far more overall happiness. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=267))

> “The negative effects of stress outweigh the positive effects of income or health in general.” ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=277))

> This implies that saving more is only beneficial if you can do it in a stress-free way. Otherwise, you will likely do yourself more harm than good. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=280))

> Similar to the effect of exercise on weight loss, cutting spending seems to have inherent limitations when it comes to saving more money. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=418))

> Increases in income aren’t followed by similar increases in spending. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=446))

> diminishing marginal utility. This is a jargonistic phrase, but its meaning is simple. It means that each additional unit of consumption brings about less benefit than the unit before it. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=456))

> Their paper clearly illustrates that many poor people stay poor not because of their talent/motivation, but because they are in low-paying jobs that they must work to survive. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=493))

> The most consistent way to get rich is to grow your income and invest in income-producing assets. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=510))

> If you want to save more, the main point is to tighten up where you can, then focus on increasing your income. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=513))

> Therefore, if you need to make more money, consider selling more of your time, or your expertise. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=529))

> The only downside to selling your time is that it doesn’t scale. One hour of work will always equal one hour of income. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=532))

> Unfortunately, similar to selling your time, selling an individual skill or service doesn’t scale. You have to do the work for each service delivered. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=546))

> While a 9 to 5 will rarely make you filthy rich, learning how to work well with people and developing your skills can be one of the best things for your career development. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=591))

> Yes, selling your time, skills, or products is great and all, but it shouldn’t be the end goal of your wealth-building journey. The end goal should be ownership—using your additional income to acquire more income-producing assets. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=613))

> The 2x Rule Focus on Maximizing Fulfillment ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=687))

> The 2x Rule works like this: Anytime I want to splurge on something, I have to take the same amount of money and invest it as well. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=690))
The expense should also include time and energy post-purchase.

> following ways was most likely to increase your overall happiness:26 Buying experiences Treating yourself (on occasion) Buying extra time Paying upfront (e.g., all-inclusive vacations) Spending on others ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=713))

> Pink discusses how autonomy (being self-directed), mastery (improving your skills), and purpose (connecting to something bigger than yourself) are the key components to human motivation and satisfaction.27 ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=724))

> After all, it’s not the purchase that makes you feel guilty, but how you justify that purchase in your head. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=737))

> Ultimately, you are the one that must figure out what you want out of life. Once you do, then spend your money accordingly. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=756))

> Lifestyle creep is when someone increases their spending after experiencing an increase in income or as a way of keeping up with their peers. ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=789))

> How much lifestyle creep can you afford? Technically it varies based on your savings rate, but for most people the answer is around 50%. ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=799))

> More importantly, saving 50% of your raises is easy to implement and remember. Half is for you and half is for future you (in retirement). Coincidentally, this idea is similar to The 2x Rule I wrote about in the prior chapter when discussing how to spend money without feeling guilty.

> This will be roughly equivalent to a 40-year payment stream discount by 4% per year. I prefer this shortcut because you can now do the math in your head.

> There is no right answer, because being rich is a relative concept. Always has been and always will be. And that relativity will be present throughout your life. ([Location 3656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3656))

> in some circumstances, time is worth far more than money. Because you can do some things with time that you could never do with money. In fact, with enough time you could even move mountains. ([Location 3694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3694))

> This is why time is, and always will be, your most important asset. How you use that time in your 20s, 30s, and 40s will have huge impacts on your life in your 50s, 60s, and 70s.

Over time, however, excessive optimism diminishes… People are not becoming depressed. They are becoming, well, realistic.”108 ([Location 3772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3772))

> Growth stocks are priced similarly to how we think of ourselves when we are young. There are high expectations and high hopes for the future. However, many of us, like many growth stocks, eventually fail to meet these high expectations. ([Location 3783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3783))
