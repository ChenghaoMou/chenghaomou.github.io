## Highlights
> When we make this mental calculation, it’s hard for big, daunting projects to compete with little dopamine hits. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=83))

> A Zettelkasten helps you produce writing. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=141))
To generate is to understand and to internalize.

> Sometimes ignorance is more comfortable than learning, because learning means we have to go through the work of changing. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=163))

> But the proper way to take notes is not to copy things word-for-word (except in the case of exact quotes). Instead, you re-write it in your own words, which is even more powerful. Second, you don't write down everything you read. You only write down the important things: Things that are interesting, relevant to your work, or that you otherwise want to retain. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=180))

> Re-writing passages, choosing keywords, and linking notes to one another all cause you to think associatively. Thinking associatively has been shown to improve mood, so that explains why note-taking is deceptively fun. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=192))

> The one thing you're trying to accomplish is to record the thought in a place where you feel confident you'll get a chance to think about it more. Then, you can get back to what you were doing. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=339))

> To write literature notes, you have to think about what you learned, and how you might explain it to a friend (or your future self). This helps you remember the material better than you would otherwise. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=347))

> When you take the extra time to re-write, only the clearest and most compelling elements survive – not to mention that you further internalize the knowledge. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=370))

> (Just don't fool yourself, as we tend to overestimate how well we'll remember something later.) ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=376))

> As you read, make fleeting notes. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=395))

> Once you've exported your highlights, review them and highlight, once again, the parts of those highlights that are the most interesting. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=410))
Only the important ones.

> Look at the highlights of your highlights and re-write the interesting ones in your own words. You're now turning your fleeting notes into a literature note. It's okay not to summarize every highlight. Only worry about the information you most want to learn or that you can foresee wanting to use in the future. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=425))

> but a couple things make condensing highlights a fruitful time for ideation: One, I've been exposed to the information a few times at this point, and it has had time to incubate in my mind – the “passive genius” I talked about in Mind Management, Not Time Management has done some work for me. Two, this is when I'm finally writing. By trying to think of how to describe the passage in my own words, I activate the associative machine, which often causes the current idea to collide with some other idea in my mind. Associative thinking promotes a positive mood, so it shouldn't be a surprise how fun this task is. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=438))

> Permanent notes should have one idea per note. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=454))---
