## Highlights
> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=61))

> The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established: network tools. This is a broad category that captures communication services like e-mail and SMS, social media networks like Twitter and Facebook, and the shiny tangle of infotainment sites like BuzzFeed and Reddit. In aggregate, the rise of these tools, combined with ubiquitous access to them through smartphones and networked office computers, has fragmented most knowledge workers’ attention into slivers.

> But as we shift to an information economy, more and more of our population are knowledge workers, and deep work is becoming a key currency—even if most haven’t yet recognized this reality. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=186))

> The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=195))

> This compressed schedule is possible because I’ve invested significant effort to minimize the shallow in my life while making sure I get the most out of the time this frees up. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=216))

> As intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and human abilities shrinks, employers are becoming increasingly likely to hire “new machines” instead of “new people.” ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=265))

> In other words, those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=280))

> Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=293))

> In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=322))

> Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy 1. The ability to quickly master hard things. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=334))

> To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things. And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=355))

> If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=361))

> You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=363))

> Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=400))

> The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.

> Generally speaking, as knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual’s efforts. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=616))

> None of these behaviors would survive long if it was clear that they were hurting the bottom line, but the metric black hole prevents this clarity and allows the shift toward distraction we increasingly encounter in the professional world. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=629))

> The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=649))

> Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=715))

> Knowledge work is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an activity that’s often at odds with busyness, not supported by it. ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=726))

> In short, I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=914))

> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=934))

> A now voluminous line of inquiry, initiated in a series of pioneering papers also written by Roy Baumeister, has established the following important (and at the time, unexpected) truth about willpower: You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1089))

> The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1095))

> This back-and-forth represents a collaborative form of deep work (common in academic circles) that leverages what I call the whiteboard effect. For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone. The presence of the other party waiting for your next insight—be it someone physically in the same room or collaborating with you virtually—can short-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth.

> On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. ([Location 1607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1607))

> The concept of a shutdown ritual might at first seem extreme, but there’s a good reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, which is named for the experimental work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention. It tells us that if you simply stop whatever you are doing at five p.m. and declare, “I’m done with work until tomorrow,” you’ll likely struggle to keep your mind clear of professional issues, as the many obligations left unresolved in your mind will, as in Bluma Zeigarnik’s experiments, keep battling for your attention throughout the evening (a battle that they’ll often win).

> In my experience, it’s common to treat undistracted concentration as a habit like flossing—something that you know how to do and know is good for you, but that you’ve been neglecting due to a lack of motivation. This mind-set is appealing because it implies you can transform your working life from distracted to focused overnight if you can simply muster enough motivation. ([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1736))

> You must resist this temptation! ([Location 1812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1812))

> The key here isn’t to avoid or even to reduce the total amount of time you spend engaging in distracting behavior, but is instead to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom. ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1830))

It tells us that if you simply stop whatever you are doing at five p.m. and declare, “I’m done with work until tomorrow,” you’ll likely struggle to keep your mind clear of professional issues, as the many obligations left unresolved in your mind will, as in Bluma Zeigarnik’s experiments, keep battling for your attention throughout the evening (a battle that they’ll often win).

## Highlights
> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=61))

> The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established: network tools. This is a broad category that captures communication services like e-mail and SMS, social media networks like Twitter and Facebook, and the shiny tangle of infotainment sites like BuzzFeed and Reddit. In aggregate, the rise of these tools, combined with ubiquitous access to them through smartphones and networked office computers, has fragmented most knowledge workers’ attention into slivers.

It tells us that if you simply stop whatever you are doing at five p.m. and declare, “I’m done with work until tomorrow,” you’ll likely struggle to keep your mind clear of professional issues, as the many obligations left unresolved in your mind will, as in Bluma Zeigarnik’s experiments, keep battling for your attention throughout the evening (a battle that they’ll often win).
