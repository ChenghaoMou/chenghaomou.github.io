## Highlights
> But something jumped out at me that changed what I wanted to write about today. It was this line in particular (emphasis mine):
> > For example, one company that had previously completed a successful agile transformation learned that its developers, instead of coding, were spending too much time on low-value-added tasks such as provisioning infrastructure, running manual unit tests, and managing test data. Armed with that insight, **it launched a series of new tools and automation projects** to help with those tasks across the software development life cycle.
> I realized that I missed the whole point of this post. **The goal isn’t to gain insight, it’s to justify funding a new program inside an organization.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9gvbvmx3pp8asa7vks6g3k7))

> In order to effect change in an organization, you need political capital, even if you’re an executive. That’s because making change in an organization is hard, programs are expensive and don’t bear fruit for a long time, and so you need to get buy-in in order to make things happen.

> McKinsey is a management consulting firm. One of the services that management consulting firms provide is that ***they will sell you political capital***. They provide a report generated by external experts that their customers can use as leverage within their organizations to justify change programs.

> And, so, it makes perfect sense that McKinsey & Company would write a blog post like this. They are, effectively, a political-capital-as-a-service (PCaaS?) company. Helping executives justify programs inside of companies is what they do for a living. But they can’t simply state explicitly how the magic trick actually works, because then it won’t work anymore.
