## Highlights
> There’s always a tension — recruiters are, by and large, good human beings who genuinely want to help their candidates, but they also have an employer they’re beholden to, as well as a comp/bonus structure that rewards certain behaviors, some of which run counter to candidates’ best interests. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9kdyk9040jmwvam7897qk8w))

> Third party recruiters are incentivized to get the deal done, not to risk the deal by negotiating hard for you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9ke0j7gga85vtxneawsb5gm))

> They’re incentivized, first and foremost, to follow the rules their head of department sets for them. This is true for how they evaluate candidates, who they let through, and how they read resumes. And it’s definitely true for how they negotiate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9ke1my00eg92dtst26v197f))

> The reality is that negotiation is all about preparation and leverage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9ke2a5vjpdwq5jkcxzetr5k))

> The most obvious way to lose leverage is revealing information about money. The other way to lose leverage is by sharing information about where else you’re interviewing. If you share this information, you risk prematurely scaring off smaller companies because they don’t think they can win in a bidding war with FAANG. You also risk cornering yourself into a situation where the company knows your options are limited, and they might be inclined to lowball you as a result. Finally, you risk getting an exploding offer to try to force you to make a decision before you’re ready. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9ke59twzxwm9hrppy2esntt))

> When you share the actual timeline you’re working with, you no longer control the timing of your job search, and a huge part of negotiation is controlling timing so you can make all your offers come in at the same time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9kea6yd2ffwm4p5zhtvbv1h))

> f I negotiated an increase then, I would have had to renegotiate when I received the higher offer. This will cause negotiating fatigue for you and the company. They will be less likely to negotiate a second time because they don’t know how many times you will ask them for more. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9kec0264bx9t7f4mh654420))

> The casual nature of texting lulls you into a false sense of security. Moreover, the fact that texts interrupt you from something else puts you at a disadvantage — when you get interrupted, your instinct is to quickly respond to make the interruption go away. But knee-jerk responses are rarely the right ones, and you’ll find yourself giving away information you shouldn’t have. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9keevfpc5csg0f8d0j1m0x8))

> I’m not sure exactly what number I’m looking for, but if you’d be able to share what an offer package might look like, then I will gladly iterate on it with you if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9kehxjk121dgb7rvm4vfb6f))---
