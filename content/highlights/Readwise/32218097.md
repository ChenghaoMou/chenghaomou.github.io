## Highlights
> There is no standard tooling for microservices-based development - there is no common framework. Working on distributed systems has gotten only marginally easier in 2020s. The Dockers and the Kuberneteses of the world did not magically take away the inherent complexity of a distributed setup. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01had3h1gv5receg4dgw70g0k7))

> The [audit](https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/lessons-from-5-years-of-startup-code-audits/id341623264?i=1000567623452) revealed an interesting pattern, where many startups experienced a sort of collective imposter syndrome while building straight-forward, simple, performant systems. There is a dogma attached to not starting out with microservices on day one - no matter the problem. “Everyone is doing microservices, yet we have a single Django monolith maintained by just a few engineers, and a MySQL instance - what are we doing wrong?”.
