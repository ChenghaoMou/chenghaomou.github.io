## Highlights
> In place of fundamental social changes, the computer allows technical solutions to be proposed that would allow existing power hierarchies to remain intact. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcqqvampwphrarczh4bbew2v))

> Weizenbaum insisted on crucial differences between humans and machines, arguing that there are certain domains that involve interpersonal connection, respect, affection, and understanding into which computers ought not to intrude, regardless of whether it appears they can ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcqqysxt3sx6qfaef96609en))
