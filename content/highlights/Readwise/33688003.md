> The context of one’s life defines not just *what* but *how* one thinks, and a job tends to dominate the context of one’s life — particularly when that job is considered to be part of a career. Your job will change you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he00m73nvv5ytaffd8beyf9q))

> Things that are treyf, you avoid, not because you hate them per se, but because in avoiding them you keep yourself from becoming like the people you hate.

There’s a reason the bulk of the first class passengers resemble each other, just as there’s a reason prison guards tend to act the same.
