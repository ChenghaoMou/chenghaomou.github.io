## Highlights
> Most people are slow to start anything. Because our society is trained and wired for consumption, most people spend their morning consuming things on their phone. Because of this, they never get into a “FLOW” state during their day. Most people are so trapped in consumption they’re dependent upon it just to get going in the morning.

> Most people are suffering from what psychologists call a low-level [default future](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20553) where they don’t have a big vision or high expectations for their life.
> Most people are consuming information, food, and even people and experiences that have created a low-level worldview and identity for themselves.
> Low-level becomes the standard for your brain when that’s what you feed it on a repetitive, daily basis.
> Your brain is a prediction machine. It will take what you give it.
> Your identity will perform with what it has to work with — what you give it. You cannot outperform your identity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfq6179gnxmva7jpaq0sdtsx))

> Most people’s vision of their future self is basically getting to the next paycheck or getting to the next weekend. They don’t have clarity on who their future self is, and they *certainly* don’t have a massive and compelling future self.
> They don’t have what entrepreneur and founder of XPrize Peter Diamandis would call a Massive Transformative Purpose, or MTP.
> > “Your Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP) is a clear statement that guides, empowers, and inspires you. It helps you decide what to do, and more importantly what not to do.

> Unfortunately, most people have a 2x vision, even though this is psychologically destructive. In psychology this is actually known as the “default” future. There’s a lot of research showing that because people have a 2x vision, they underestimate who their future self will be. Most 18-year-olds don’t think they’re going to transform that much, despite most older people being in a *dramatically* different situation than when they were 18. Because of the “end of history illusion” [made popular by Dr. Daniel Gilbert](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_the_psychology_of_your_future_self), most people think who they’ve always been is who they’re always going to be.

> Your 80% is your security blanket.

> > “People tend to **overweigh options that are certain, and are risk averse for gains**. We would rather get an assured, lesser win than take the chance at winning more (but also risk possibly getting nothing). The opposite is true when dealing with certain losses: people engage in risk-seeking behavior to avoid a bigger loss.” — [Aurora Harley](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prospect-theory/) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfq6e6wmhx4gz8bj1tay0dqy))

> The challenge most people have as soon as they start becoming successful is that they’re no longer operating out of need, and they don’t know how to create a vision of what they want, because all they’ve ever done up until that point was from the perspective of need.
