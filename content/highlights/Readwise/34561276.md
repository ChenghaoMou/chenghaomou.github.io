## Highlights
> AI definitely should *not* aspire to replicate the human mind in every detail. We already have 8 billion human minds, many pretty problematic; we shouldn’t aspire for more of the same.
> The point of AI should not be to replicate us, but to supplement us, where we are cognitively frail (calculators are great at that! and spreadsheets! and databases!), and to pitch where we would prefer not to go, helping us, for example, with jobs that robotics call “dull, dirty, and dangerous”.

> *For now, humans aren’t more intelligent than machines or vice versa, we are just differently abled.* *As Ali G once said in a different context, “neither is better”.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hg3sb5b9yxs2be3wc3g3g19t))---
