# The Curious Joy of Being Wrong
## Highlights
> Intellectual humility is a particular kind of humility that has to do with beliefs, ideas or worldviews. This is not only about religious beliefs; it can show up in political views, various social attitudes, areas of knowledge or expertise or any other strong convictions. It has both internal- and external-facing dimensions.
> Within yourself, intellectual humility involves awareness and ownership of the [limitations and biases](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2017.12.014) in what you know and how you know it. It requires a willingness to [revise your views](https://doi.org/10.1080/00223891.2015.1068174) in light of strong evidence.

Remember, it’s being the right size, not too small. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk8r9khxc1811tde5f3z607y))---
