# AI Is Already Killing Books

## Highlights
> There is no feeling of betrayal like thinking you are about to read something that another person slaved over, only to discover you've been tricked. They had an idea, maybe even a good idea and instead of putting in the work and actually sitting there crafting something worth my precious hours on this Earth to read, they wasted my time with LLM dribble. Those too formal, politically neutral, long-winded paragraphs stare back at me as the ultimate indictment of how little of a shit the person who "wrote this" cared about my experience reading it. It's like getting served a microwave dinner at a sit down restaurant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkfqrez7pcrxvmxhp5317a2e))

> I quickly expanded, growing from this historical text to a wide range of topics. I quickly find there is someone there to meet me at every stage of life. When I'm lonely or angry as a teenager I find those authors and stories that speak to that, put those feelings into a context and bigger picture. *This isn't a new experience, people have felt this way going back to the very beginning.* So much of the value isn't just the words, it's the sense of a relationship between me and the author. When you encounter this in fiction or in historical text, you come to understand as overwhelming as it feels *in that second* it is part of being a human being. This person experienced it and lived, you will too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkfr4s969sf14s7yqfn6b47b))

> The sad part is this is unstoppable. eBooks are too easy to make with LLMs and no reliable detection systems exist to screen them before they're uploaded to the market. Amazon has no interest in setting realistic limits to how many books users can upload to the Kindle Store, still letting people upload a laughable *three books a day*. Google Play Store seems to have no limit, same with Apple Books. It's depressing that another market will become so crowded with trash, but nobody in a position to change it seems to care.
