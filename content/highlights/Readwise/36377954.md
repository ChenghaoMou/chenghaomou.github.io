# Generative AI Has a Visual Plagiarism Problem

## Highlights
> These results provide powerful evidence ... that at least some generative AI systems may produce plagiaristic outputs, even when not directly asked to do so, potentially exposing users to copyright infringement claims. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkk1st39p6w3t0z3h9bqpzsc))

> We find these practices—banning users and discouraging red-teaming—unacceptable. The only way to ensure that tools are valuable, safe, and not exploitative is to allow the community an opportunity to investigate; this is precisely why the community has generally agreed that red-teaming is an important part of AI development, particularly because these systems are as yet far from fully understood ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkk2dyj276znmx9mx0436sf0))

> The very existence of potentially infringing outputs is evidence of another problem: the nonconsensual use of copyrighted human work to train machines. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkk2qpd9zpnt6f93cdv83h9v))

> In keeping with the intent of international law protecting both intellectual property and human rights, no creator’s work should ever be used for commercial training without consent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkk2qwces67ajrq8r04mcbaw))

> If you find an image via Google, you can follow that link in order to try to determine whether the image is in the public domain, from a stock agency, and so on. In a generative AI system, the invited inference is that the creation is original artwork that the user is free to use. No manifest of how the artwork was created is supplied ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkk2t5095j108m43r4bevbpb))

> Following up on the *The New York Times* lawsuit, our results suggest that generative AI systems may regularly produce plagiaristic outputs, both written and visual, without transparency or compensation, in ways that put undue burdens on users and content creators.
