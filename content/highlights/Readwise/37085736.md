# Rich People Don't Talk to Robots

## Highlights
> Rich people do not attempt to save money on professional services and advice. They donâ€™t want the cheapest doctor, lawyer, accountant, personal trainer, financial advisor, psychologist, college advisor, etc. They want the best available and, within reason, they are happy to pay for it so long as they feel they are getting value for their money.
