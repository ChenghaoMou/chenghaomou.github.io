> The choice is not between them building AI or not, it is between them building AI for *free* or building AI by *paying* for their raw materials, doing what lots of companies like Netflix and Spotify do routinely: *licensing* copyrighted materials that they commercialize. OpenAI knows this fill well. Even as OpenAI implied to the House of Lords that “free” was the only option, behind the scenes they were busy negotiating licenses.
