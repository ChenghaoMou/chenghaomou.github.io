# A Unified Theory of Fucks

## Highlights
> If I’m being honest, I told this story to myself more than anyone else. I needed an explanation for why a well I’d been drawing from all my life had suddenly run dry, why things I had cared about seemed so abruptly to matter little at all.

> And my answer is: *don’t.* Don’t give a fuck about your work. *Give all your fucks to the living.* Give a fuck about the people you work with, and the people who receive your work—the people who use the tools and products and systems or, more often than not, are used by them. Give a fuck about the land and the sea, all the living things that are used or used up by the work, that are abandoned or displaced by it, or—if we’re lucky, if we’re persistent and brave and willing—are cared for through the work. Give a fuck about yourself, about your own wild and tender spirit, about your peace and especially about [your art](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/energy-makes-time/). Give every last fuck you have to living things with beating hearts and breathing lungs and open eyes, with chloroplasts and mycelia and water-seeking roots, with wings and hands and leaves. Give like every fuck might be your last. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn837ss6ngt0w68mxj4s0xyn))---
