# Mamba

A new variant of [[20240217101251|State Space Model]] where $B$, $C$, and $\Delta$ are input-dependent and thus time-varying.

Such change renders the convolutional formulation impossible since each time step requires different parameters. Parallel scan, while being hardware-aware, a.k.a utilising memory hierarchy, and kernel fusion, are introduced to speed up the calculation.

Futhermore, recalculation of the activations is also used to save the memory load.
