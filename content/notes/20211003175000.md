# Contrastive Learning

The idea of contrastive learning is to learn representations where similar input will have closer representations and vice versa, without explicitly modeling the similarity.

Although, similarities based on single values, such as cosine similarity, shows no insight on how semantic similarity manifests from various perspectives, a better solution might be [[20221222133828|Decomposing Embeddings]].

This also relates to duplicate detection, where a single cosine similarity only shows global pixel similarities but never the local similarities (objects or backgrounds in images)[^1]. In this case, the authors proposed split product that measures segment-level cosine similarities[^1].
