# Investment VS Saving

The formula tells which to bet on investment versus saving:
1. How much do you expect to save **comfortably** in the next year $S$;
2. How much do you expect your investment to grow in the next year $G$;
3. If $S$ > $G$, then you should focus on saving money
4. If $S$ < $G$, you should focus on fine-tuning investment
5. Else, you should focus on both of them equally
