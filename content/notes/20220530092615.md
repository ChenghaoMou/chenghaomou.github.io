Source: [[20220530100701|Just Keep Buying]]

We return to our normal level of happiness even after experiencing some positive events in the short term. This is called [Hedonic treadmill - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill#:~:text=Hedonic%20adaptation%20is%20a%20process,that%20occur%20in%20their%20environment.).

Then it is clear that chasing after happiness is a wrong quest, and instead, we should aim for fulfilment — making an impact with our decisions and making it count. Or as someone may call it, contentment[^1] [^2].
