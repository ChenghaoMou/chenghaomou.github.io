# Growth Stocks

Stocks with high expectations and high hopes for the future. [[31554992|Just Keep Buying]] uses this term as an analogy to our early life, eventually failing to meet those expectations. When we grow older, we transition into [[20220620185630]] Value Stocks. Such transition resembles the Happiness Curve[^1].
