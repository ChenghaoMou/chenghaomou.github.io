# Making Connections in Zettelkasten

[[20220724214948|Connections]] are crucial components in the slip box system, and the process of making them should take the most of your note-taking efforts to maximize your learning and understanding. Without those connections, the notes we take are archives that can never promote insights.

There are [[20220821144614|Two Types of Connections in Digital Zettelkasten]].

Making connections or associations is also a useful trick to [[20220528132200|make things memorable]]. Our brain might prune connections to operate more efficiently as we age[^1], but we do not need to do this in our slip box because it grows freely in a digital space.

You can search your slip box for potential connections by asking the following questions:
1. What does it include in this note?
2. What does it fail to include?
3. What claims does it support or disprove?
4. Is there any similar information related to this?
5. What difference does it make to your current understanding or to your project?
