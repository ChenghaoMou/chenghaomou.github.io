# Octopus Test

Octopus Test is proposed in [[Climbing towards NLU On Meaning Form and Understanding in the Age of Data]] and is constructed as follows:

1. An Octopus listens to a conversation between two people under the sea for an infinite amount of time.
2. The Octopus could learn enough statistical patterns to attack the conversation as a "middle-octopus".
3. But the fact the octopus cannot and will never understand a word such as *coconut* or anything or any novel situation on the land since it never really get the chance to experience them beyond words.

Consequently, two more narrowed tests are proposed to illustrate the problem:

1. Java test: a model trained with every Java program (just the program, without inputs and outputs) will fail to execute them because it simply doesn't know how execution works. Such execution (from code to machine bytes to CPU instructions) is the equivalent to our [[20220904143432|Communicative Intents]] that are beyond text.
2. A system that trains text and image separately with unsupervised learning or self-supervised training (or just two random pre-trained LM and CV models) will undoubtedly fail to perform an image QA task. The training or the data is insufficient to capture such relation.
