## Rank-One Model Editing

As described in [[20221113155122#^9eca9d]], we now can apply changes to model weights to take in a new "fact".

By treating a linear projection as [Associative Memory], we can update the weights to take in a new fact by calculating the following:

$$
\hat{W}k_* = v_*
$$

Where $\hat{W}$ is the new weight matrix, $k_*$ is the query vector for the subject, and $v_*$ is the value vector for the new fact (under the same subject and relation).

$k_*$ can be calculated by averaging hidden states over different context for a given subject beforehand, which can be seen as a universal subject query vector.

$v_*$, on the other hand, can be calculated by finding a $z$ that minimizes the loss:

$z$ is defined as the output hidden state at layer $l$ and step $i$. (This seems like some computation)

After we have both $k_*$ and $v_*$, we can calculate the updated $\hat{W}$ and plug it back into the model.
