Information Seeking Strategies analyzes the interaction users have with a search engine from four aspects:

## Method

The method of interacting includes searching and scanning:
- **Searching** is similar to depth first search. We know what we are searching for.
- **Scanning** is similar to breadth first search, sense-making during the process. We don't know what we want[^1].

## Goal

The goal of interaction can be selecting or learning:
- **Selecting** is when the goal is to pick some items that meet your criterion.
- **Learning** is when the goal is to discover and learn diverse aspects of a subject.

## Mode

- Specification is searching with filters.
- Recognition is searching with extra questions.

## Resource

We can either select based on the content (Information), or the metadata of such content (Metadata).

In total, there can be 16 different scenarios from such four aspects.
