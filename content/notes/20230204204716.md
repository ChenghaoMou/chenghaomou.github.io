# IQ Test

The idea of condensing a person's intellectual capacity into a single number is problematic, to say the least. It was popularized largely by 20th-century eugenicists and often cited as "scientific proof" to exclude and marginalize non-white communities[^1].

**Even what was perceived as philanthropic acts can stem from problematic eugenic beliefs â€” Effective Altruism is a perfect example.**
