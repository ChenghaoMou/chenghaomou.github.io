# Optimizing For Feelings

Reference: [[Optimizing For Feelings|Optimizing For Feelings]]

In the absence of metrics and benchmarks, it is best to focus on feelings when building things â€” feelings of your own and feelings of your audience.

Similar to how we seek **resonance** when we build our second brain, we seek the connection and mutual understanding of a question from both sides. Even though much of the building is influenced by profit-driven decisions, we should always be prepared to ask difficult questions regarding those choices.
