# The Model Centipede

Based on an idea mentioned in [[The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI|The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI]], the model centipede is the scenario where AI models are so pervasive and yet so stupid that they inevitably start to ingest other models' content without discrimination[^1].

It's not just about information that is wrong, but also information that's too generic to be useful or trustworthy[^2]. Some companies might train the model to avoid criticizing themselves, based on either unintentional bias throughout the process or conscious efforts to stay away from bad publicity.
