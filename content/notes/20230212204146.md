# AI Democratization

Reference: [[What Do We Mean When We Talk About “AI Democratisation”-|What Do We Mean When We Talk About “AI Democratisation”?]]

## Use

This is often the default case when people talk about democratizing AI: people, developers or not, can use such models or services, with paid API access.

But this use-case is also the most hyped in marketing, where the word implicitly becomes a synonym of capitalization.

## Development

Having access to the design and development processes of a model.

## Benefits

Distributing benefits or profits generated by AI products more equitably.

## Governance

Distributing influence over model-related decisions to a broader community of stakeholders.

But strangely, the responsibility and enforcement are often overlooked and understated. The governance is often limited to the ones who enjoy the riches and are kind enough to pretend to worry about some distant future doomsday risks[^1].
