# Connection Engine

Inspiration: [[Google shattered human connection|Google shattered human connection]]

The information-seeking journey is a lot more than getting the answer. [[20221120131625|Situating Search]] outlined some of the reasons why it is a bad idea to synthesize an answer without any context or present it by ripping it from its context. But part of the journey is also exposure to communities or people with similar interests or issues. It is getting a chance to be involved in conversations with another human being on the Internet.

Doing an Internet search doesn't have to be a battle; it also shouldn't feel like spoon-feeding. With the increasing development of technology and its ability to grab our attention, we need connection engines instead of search engines.

- Connection engines give you the ability and access to get the answer, while search engines give you the answer directly;
- Search engines can come and go, but communities and our connections rarely do;
- Search engines give you one voice, but communities and connections give you diverse voices and leave the choice to you;
