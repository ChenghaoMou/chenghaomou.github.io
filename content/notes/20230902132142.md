# Return-to-Office and Productivity

Hypotheses:
1. It's always been done like this;
2. If I can see you at work, you must be working;

#1 and #2 always seem to go hand in hand when it comes to office productivity. The underlying assumption that being present in the office is productive is as absurd as it can get.

It is about control and incompetency in evaluating and setting goals[^1].

Do employers really care how things get completed when the deliverables planned are shipped on time? Unless you are micromanaging, then not really. The issue is that they are terrible at planning and communicating those targets, let alone managing expectations. When showing up in the office is the only way they can grasp how much "effort" you are putting in, this becomes the metric black hole phenomenon mentioned in [[31554997|Deep Work]].

But is it possible to measure productivity? There are some metrics like [[20230821203733|DORA Metrics]] or [[20230821204329|SPACE Metrics]], but they are often only effective in theory[^2].
