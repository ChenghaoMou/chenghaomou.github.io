Main takeaways:
1. Most CV papers published by institutions and nations with downstream patents are used in surveillance, *regardless of the subfield*, specifically on **human bodies, human body parts, human spaces, and socially salient human data**.
2. Many such papers and patents conflate humans as objects and, as a result, evade social and ethical consequences and responsibilities. On the surface, it presents the paper as technically objective, but in reality, it is always somewhat biased under "social and cultural norms, funding priorities, academic trends, researcher objectives, and research incentives".

Fighting for our privacy has never been easy, but when the smartest of us are either trying to get our information, click some ads or become addicted to a platform, it certainly feels hopeless.
