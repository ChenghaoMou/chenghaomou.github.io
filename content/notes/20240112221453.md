Buying an expensive electronic device and not being able to use it as one likes while telling people who actually demand to do that to have their business elsewhere definitely sounds like an anti-[[20231224125929|Interoperability]] cult.

We never really had a chance to see what the alternative looks like in real life. The closest one I can think of is the jailbreak version — Cydia. But it was only a niche application for technical tinkers. One can't help but ask how much of the security and privacy pretence is actually true and how much of it is contingent on profits.
