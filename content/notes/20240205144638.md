# Negative Externalities

Negative consequences, as a result of actions from one party, are imposed upon another party.

This is the case with environmental pollution — neighborhoos around factories are bearing the consequneces, and AI development —the entire community had to suffer labor theft and misinformation while AI companies reap the profits[^1].
