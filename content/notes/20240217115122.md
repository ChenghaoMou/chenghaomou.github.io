# Mamba

A new variant of [[20240217101251|State Space Model]] where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are input-dependent and thus time-varying.

Such change renders the convolutional formulation impossible since each time step requires different parameters. However, such sequential calculation can be remedied by parallel scan, compound with hardware-aware implementation utilising memory hierarchy, and kernel fusions.

Futhermore, recalculation of the activations is also used to save the memory load.
