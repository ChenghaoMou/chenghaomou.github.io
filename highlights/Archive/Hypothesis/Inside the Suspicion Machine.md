# Inside the Suspicion Machine
## Highlights

<mark>Rotterdam’s algorithm is best thought of as a suspicion machine. It judges people on many characteristics they cannot control (like gender and ethnicity). What might appear to a caseworker to be a vulnerability, such as a person showing signs of low self-esteem, is treated by the machine as grounds for suspicion when the caseworker enters a comment into the system. The data fed into the algorithm ranges from invasive (the length of someone’s last romantic relationship) and subjective (someone’s ability to convince and influence others) to banal (how many times someone has emailed the city) and seemingly irrelevant (whether someone plays sports). Despite the scale of data used to calculate risk scores, it performs little better than random selection.</mark>


<mark>The spread of risk-scoring models is presented as progress, promising mathematical objectivity and fairness. Yet citizens have no real way to understand or question the decisions such systems make.</mark>


<mark>But the algorithm learns to make its predictions based on a pattern it extrapolates from the training data that collapses honest mistakes and deliberate fraud into one category: fraud. It tries to find commonalities between people making paperwork mistakes and people deliberately trying to cheat the system. The consequence is that it is not very good at predicting either. “The algorithm converts ‘honest mistakes’ into learned associations between poor Dutch skills and propensity for fraud, allowing welfare officials to claim that migrants who do not speak Dutch are scientifically untrustworthy,” says Dressel.</mark>
