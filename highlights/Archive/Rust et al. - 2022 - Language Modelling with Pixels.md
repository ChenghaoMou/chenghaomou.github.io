> We pretrain the 86M parameter PIXEL model on the same English data as BERT and evaluate on syntactic and semantic tasks in typologically diverse languages, including various non-Latin scripts.

> We set height H = 16 and width W = 8464 and choose C = 3 RGB input channels, which is equivalent to a square colour image with a 368 ⇥ 368 resolu- tion and corresponds to a sequence of 529 image patches of size 16 ⇥ 16 pixels.6

> PIXEL uses span masking with a 25% masking ratio as outlined in Algorithm 1, which masks spans of up to S = 6 consecutive image patches with a dynamic num- ber of unmasked patches left between them.

> Following ViT-MAE (He et al., 2022), the PIXEL encoder only processes unmasked patches (i.e., ⇡ 396 “visible” patches at 25% masking) rather than on a sequence including mask tokens, which not only reduces memory requirements and increases training speed, but also has the advantage of not creating a mismatch between pretraining and finetuning.

> For longer spans with a larger possible prediction space, multiple predictions may appear together creating blurred text.

> We see that PIXEL achieves non-trivial performance scores on GLUE, indicating that pixel-based encoders can learn higher- level semantic tasks, but performs worse overall than BERT, so it may require (a) more pretraining steps than subword-tokenized PLMs or (b) an additional inductive bias to acquire the same level of monolingual abstraction.

> Inligatures,ascommonforinstanceinArabic,aglyph is composed of multiple characters. Likewise, an emoji often consists of a base codepoint and a modifier codepoint (e.g. to change the emoji skin colour) which are represented by a single glyph.
