## Highlights

Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. — location: [134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=134) ^ref-34188

---
There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. — location: [139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=139) ^ref-46218

---
They struggle because they believe, as they are made to believe, that writing starts with a blank page. — location: [153](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=153) ^ref-14996

---
The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. — location: [158](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=158) ^ref-7008

---
What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004). — location: [166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=166) ^ref-40079

---
Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=179) ^ref-21610

---
A good, structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time. — location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=200) ^ref-11454

---
To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement – which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=203) ^ref-15126

---
The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery – or insight. — location: [208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=208) ^ref-21110

---
Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas. — location: [213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=213) ^ref-11316

---
All that means is that a system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information, which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim of generating new ideas. — location: [224](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=224) ^ref-16439

---
In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations – as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison. That means that those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=228) ^ref-11888

---
This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994). — location: [236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=236) ^ref-6812

---
The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. — location: [251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=251) ^ref-27801

---
It is not about redoing what you have done before, but about changing the way of working from now on. — location: [257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=257) ^ref-59307

---
There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have. Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway. — location: [257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=257) ^ref-5229

---
Like every change in behaviour, a change in working habits means going through a phase where you are drawn back to your old ways. — location: [266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=266) ^ref-54530

---
The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture. — location: [274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=274) ^ref-25858

---
All the little steps must be linked in a way that will enable you to go seamlessly from one task to another, but still be kept separate enough to enable us to flexibly do what needs to be done in any given situation. — location: [300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=300) ^ref-8591

---
Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand. — location: [302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=302) ^ref-41895

---
one note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarily the context it was taken from. — location: [319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=319) ^ref-2707

---
It is in the nature of writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that questions change, the material we work with turns out to be very different from the one imagined or that new ideas emerge, which might change our whole perspective on what we do. — location: [375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=375) ^ref-56516

---
Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). — location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=381) ^ref-29717

---
This is not just about having the right mindset, it is also about having the right workflow. — location: [384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=384) ^ref-28139

---
It is about having the right tools and knowing how to use them – and very few understand that you need both. — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=386) ^ref-28914

---
The main misunderstanding stems from an isolated focus on the slip-box and a neglect of the actual workflow in which it is embedded. — location: [397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=397) ^ref-28033

---
Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means. — location: [403](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=403) ^ref-32022

---
Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box. — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=419) ^ref-10052

literature notes

---
He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box. — location: [422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=422) ^ref-7693

---
And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material. — location: [426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=426) ^ref-4678

---
The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. The numbers bore no meaning and were only there to identify each note permanently. If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note. — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=435) ^ref-39499

---
Adding a note directly behind another note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system. — location: [442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=442) ^ref-38422

---
We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. But first, let me guide you through the process of writing a paper with the slip-box. — location: [457](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=457) ^ref-42999

---
Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done. — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=485) ^ref-38460

---
Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. — location: [491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=491) ^ref-26275

---
If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=496) ^ref-5551

---
You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write. — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=502) ^ref-5369

---
If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. — location: [503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=503) ^ref-60555

---
Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. — location: [511](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=511) ^ref-44656

---
They should not cause any distraction. Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later. I usually have a simple notebook with me, but I am happy with napkins or receipts if nothing else is at hand. — location: [512](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=512) ^ref-9499

---
If your thoughts are already sorted and you have the time, you can skip this step and write your idea directly down as a proper, permanent note for your slip-box. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=514) ^ref-1383

---
Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=516) ^ref-21455

---
Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place – your reference system. — location: [519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=519) ^ref-22979

---
Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. — location: [521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=521) ^ref-44353

---
box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. — location: [521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=521) ^ref-52997

---
The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. — location: [523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=523) ^ref-718

---
Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. — location: [525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=525) ^ref-21307

---
Look to which note the new one directly relates or, if it does not relate directly to any other note yet, just file it behind the last one. — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=532) ^ref-5429

---
Making sure you will be able to find this note later by either linking to it from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point to a discussion or topic and is itself linked to the index. — location: [536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=536) ^ref-49872

---
See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about. — location: [539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=539) ^ref-38999

---
Look through the connections and collect all the relevant notes on this topic (most of the relevant notes will already be in partial order), copy them onto your “desktop”[6] and bring them in order. Look for what is missing and what is redundant. Don’t wait until you have everything together. Rather, try ideas out and give yourself enough time to go back to reading and note-taking to improve your ideas, arguments and their structure. — location: [550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=550) ^ref-9893

---
Turn your notes into a rough draft. Don’t simply copy your notes into a manuscript. Translate them into something coherent and embed them into the context of your argument while you build your argument out of the notes at the same time. — location: [555](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=555) ^ref-37746

---
In reality, you never work on just one idea, but many ideas in different stages at the same time. And that is where the system plays out its real strengths. — location: [560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=560) ^ref-31923

---
You might read a certain book in hope it could be useful for one of the papers you write. Maybe you are wrong, but it still might contain — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=563) ^ref-33176

---
some interesting thoughts worth keeping and useful for something else you haven’t thought about yet. — location: [564](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=564) ^ref-38869

---
Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn. — location: [578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=578) ^ref-63723

---
Each added bit of information, filtered only by our interest, is a contribution to our future understanding, thinking and writing. — location: [581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=581) ^ref-58985

---
Academic writing in itself is not a complicated process that requires a variety of complicated tools, but is in constant danger of being clogged with unnecessary distractions. — location: [595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=595) ^ref-54418

---
Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking. The slip-box provides an external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information. — location: [612](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=612) ^ref-5709

---
They only function as a reminder of a thought and are not meant to capture the thought itself, which requires time to phrase proper sentences and check facts. — location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=631) ^ref-58951

---
They can’t speed up the main part of the work, which is thinking, reading and understanding. — location: [648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=648) ^ref-57886

---
Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them. — location: [665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=665) ^ref-55531

---
But with tools like the slip-box, we sometimes forget that the handling is as important as the possibilities of the tool itself. — location: [669](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=669) ^ref-41318

---
If we try to use a tool without putting any thought into the way we work with it, even the best tool would not be of much help. The slip-box, for example, would most likely be used as an archive for notes – or worse: a graveyard for thoughts (cf. Hollier 2005, 40 on Mallarmé’s index cards). — location: [670](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=670) ^ref-11349

assumption: Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research. — location: [702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=702) ^ref-43809

---
Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community — location: [704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=704) ^ref-19010

---
An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. — location: [705](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=705) ^ref-45883

---
the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter. — location: [710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=710) ^ref-1075

---
The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, regardless of who the author is or the status of the publisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=716) ^ref-46418

---
If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing. — location: [719](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=719) ^ref-4692

---
Working as if nothing else counts than writing does not mean spending more time writing at the expense of everything else. — location: [721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=721) ^ref-35478

---
You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don’t understand what it is about. — location: [734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=734) ^ref-3965

---
And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). — location: [736](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=736) ^ref-29571

---

Working like this will leave you with a lot of different notes in many different places. Writing, then, means to rely heavily on your brain to remember where and when these notes were written down. A text must then be conceptualised independently from these notes, which explains why so many resort to brainstorming to arrange the resources afterwards according to this preconceived idea. — location: [782](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=782) ^ref-52127

---
In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? — location: [787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=787) ^ref-39458

---
The slip-box is the shipping container of the academic world. Instead of having different storage for different ideas, everything goes into the same slip-box and is standardised into the same format. — location: [791](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=791) ^ref-62594

---
Even though the slip-box, being organised bottom-up, does not face the trade-off problem between too many or too few topics, it too can lose its value when notes are added to it indiscriminately. It can only play out its strengths when we aim for a critical mass, which depends not only on the number of notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled. — location: [799](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=799) ^ref-14059

---
Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two. — location: [804](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=804) ^ref-62847

---
Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the reference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box. — location: [806](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=806) ^ref-39957

---
Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished. — location: [810](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=810) ^ref-24047

---
The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. — location: [818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=818) ^ref-17123

---
The second typical mistake is to collect notes only related to specific projects. — location: [822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=822) ^ref-57713

---
ups. Just collecting unprocessed fleeting notes inevitably leads to chaos. Even small amounts of unclear and unrelated notes lingering around your desk will soon induce the wish of starting from scratch. — location: [831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=831) ^ref-26974

---
What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way. — location: [833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=833) ^ref-6707

---
margins. It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. They will very soon become completely useless – unless you do something with them. — location: [842](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=842) ^ref-19571

---
Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. — location: [844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=844) ^ref-63672

---
Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. — location: [848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=848) ^ref-65000

---
away. That is why the threshold to write an idea down has to be as low as possible, but it is equally crucial to elaborate on them within a day or two. — location: [850](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=850) ^ref-17946

---
A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. — location: [851](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=851) ^ref-25301

---
The only permanently stored notes are the literature notes in the reference system and the main notes in the slip-box. The former can be very brief as the context is clearly the text they refer to. The latter need be written with more care and details as they need to be self-explanatory. — location: [854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=854) ^ref-8068

---

To be able to decide on a topic, one must already have read quite a bit and certainly not just about one topic.

It accompanies everything: We have to read with a pen in hand, develop ideas on paper and build up an ever-growing pool of externalised thoughts. We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by our interest, curiosity and intuition, which is formed and informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas – and is something that continuously grows and reflects our knowledge and understanding externally. — location: [929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=929) ^ref-38017

The advice to think about what to write about before you write comes both too early and too late. Too late, as you already have passed up the chance to build up written resources when you face the white sheet of paper or the blank screen, but also too early, if you try to postpone every serious content-related work until you have made a decision on the topic. — location: [949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=949) ^ref-64233

Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words. — location: [1031](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1031) ^ref-9089

The ability to express understanding in one’s own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes – and only by doing it with the chance of realizing our lack of understanding can we become better at it. — location: [1036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1036) ^ref-59895

While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased – a lot (Wang and Tchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009). Not only the quantity but also the quality of their accomplishments lagged significantly behind that of the control group. — location: [1095](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1095) ^ref-45585

---
Multitasking is not what we think it is. It is not focusing attention on more than one thing at a time. Nobody can do that. When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again. Trying to multitask fatigues us and decreases our ability to deal with more than one task. — location: [1101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1101) ^ref-16432

The second is what psychologists call the mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it – completely independent of our actual performance (Bornstein 1989).

The widespread praise for planning rests on the misconception that a process like writing an academic text, which is highly dependent on cognition and thinking, can rely on conscious decision-making alone.

Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance. — location: [1297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1297) ^ref-31275

The outcome of reading with a pen in the hand is not possible to anticipate either, and here, too, the idea is not to copy, but to have a meaningful dialogue with the texts we read. — location: [1393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1393) ^ref-46249

This is why we have to translate them into our own language to prepare them to be embedded into new contexts of our own thinking, the different context(s) within the slip-box. — location: [1397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1397) ^ref-5435

And what is most helpful is to reflect on the frame, the theoretical background, methodological approach or perspective of the text we read.

While we should seek out dis-confirming arguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking, we are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good, which is everything that confirms what we already believe we know. — location: [1457](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1457) ^ref-48910

Yes, we have to be selective, but not in terms of pros and cons, but in terms of relevant or irrelevant.

Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text.

If we put effort into the attempt of retrieving information, we are much more likely to remember it in the long run, even if we fail to retrieve it without help in the end (Roediger and Karpicke 2006).

Just by writing down these questions and making possible connections explicit in writing are the concepts and theories being investigated.

Writing notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than an attempt to understand the wider meaning of something.

The most common form of reference is plain note-to-note links. They have no function other than indicating a relevant connection between two individual notes.

He advocates looking out for the most powerful concepts in every discipline and to try to understand them so thoroughly that they become part of our thinking. — location: [2164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2164) ^ref-60488

Munger writes: “Well, the first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ’em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form. You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience, both vicarious and direct, on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.” (Munger 1994). — location: [2169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2169) ^ref-58788

If we practice learning not as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter a virtuous circle where learning facilitates learning. — location: [2184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2184) ^ref-27787

it. We have to elaborate on what we read just to be able to write it down and translate it into different contexts. We retrieve information from the slip-box whenever we try to connect new notes with old notes. — location: [2205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2205) ^ref-35083

But intuition is not the opposition to rationality and knowledge, it is rather the incorporated, practical side of our intellectual endeavours, the sedimented experience on which we build our conscious, explicit knowledge — location: [2229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2229) ^ref-26205

The real enemy of independent thinking is not an external authority, but our own inertia. The ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking with old habits of thinking than with coming up with as many ideas as possible. — location: [2281](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2281) ^ref-46377

We always perceive something as something – our interpretation is instantaneous. This is why we have so much trouble not falling for an optical illusion: If we look at a three-dimensional drawing, we cannot see it just as an arrangement of lines and shapes – unless we are highly trained to do so. — location: [2297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2297) ^ref-33346

To really understand a text is therefore a constant revision of our first interpretation. We have to train ourselves to get used to seeing this difference and to hold back our ingrained urge to jump to conclusions. — location: [2303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2303) ^ref-14514

While the constant comparison of notes can help us to detect differences, no technique can help us see what is missing. But we can make it a habit to always ask what is not in the picture, but could be relevant. This, too, does not come naturally to us. — location: [2309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2309) ^ref-45084

One possibility to deal with this tendency is to ask counterfactual questions, like “what if?” — location: [2332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2332) ^ref-12163

The first question should always be directed towards the question itself: What kind of answer can you expect from asking a question in this particular way? What is missing? — location: [2337](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2337) ^ref-5450

---
By using the slip-box on a daily basis, we train these important intellectual skills deliberately: We check if what we understood from a text is really in the text by having our understanding in written form in front of our eyes. We learn to focus on the gist of an idea by restricting ourselves in terms of space. We can make it a habit to always think about what is missing when we write down our own ideas. And we can practice asking good questions when we sort our notes into the slip-box and connect them with other notes. — location: [2360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2360) ^ref-38833

The restriction to one idea per note is also the precondition to recombine them freely later. — location: [2372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2372) ^ref-49050

The limitation of the canvas does not make the artistic expressions of painters seem limited, but opens up the possibility of an artist like Lucio Fontana to cut into the canvas instead of painting on it. It is not even true that a more complex structure provides more possibilities. Quite the contrary. The binary code is radically more limited than the alphabet as it contains only two states, one or zero, but it opened up a range of creative possibilities that is unprecedented. — location: [2399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2399) ^ref-32840

Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas. — location: [2404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2404) ^ref-19276

the fact that someone came up with a lot of ideas during a brainstorming session does not give much indication about their quality. — location: [2437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2437) ^ref-22921

It is now less about finding a topic to write about and more about working on the questions we generated by writing. — location: [2467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2467) ^ref-3796

---
If we, on the other hand, let questions arise from the slip-box, we know that they are tried and tested among dozens or even hundreds of other possible questions. The vast majority of questions might have been answered quickly or disappeared as no notes were drawn to them, either because of a lack of interest or a lack of material. This is how evolution works: by trial and error, not planning. — location: [2474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2474) ^ref-35239

We have to work, write, connect, differentiate, complement and elaborate on questions – but this is what we do when we take smart notes. — location: [2480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2480) ^ref-3614

Nothing motivates us more than seeing a project we can identify with moving forward, and nothing is more demotivating than being stuck with a project that doesn’t seem to be worth doing. — location: [2508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2508) ^ref-6555

If we accompany every step of our work with the question, “What is interesting about this?” and everything we read with the question, “What is so relevant about this that it is worth noting down?” we do not just choose information according to our interest. By elaborating on what we encounter, we also discover aspects we didn’t know anything about before and therefore develop our interests along the way. It would be quite sad if we did not change our interests during research. — location: [2513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2513) ^ref-61205

The ability to keep control over our work and change course if necessary is made possible by the fact that the big task of “writing a text” is broken down into small, concrete tasks, which allows us practically to do exactly what is needed at a certain time and take the next step from there. — location: [2524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2524) ^ref-46781

The key is to structure the draft visibly. It is not so much about deciding once and for all what to write in which chapter or paragraph, but what does not need to be written in a particular part of the manuscript. — location: [2545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2545) ^ref-7360

---
Everything that enriches our slip-box has the potential to end up in a text we might write. By taking smart notes, we collect en passant the material for our future writings in one place. The projects we work on can be in completely different stages of completion. Some of them might not even have come to our attention. This is advantageous not only because we make progress on the next papers or books while we are still working on the current one, but also because it allows us to switch to other projects whenever we get stuck or bored. — location: [2565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2565) ^ref-45673

The lesson to draw is to be generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome, not on the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal. — location: [2602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2602) ^ref-26960

Disassembling the big challenge of “writing a paper” into small, manageable tasks helps to set realistic goals that can be checked on a regular basis. — location: [2610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2610) ^ref-31272

According to the famous law of Parkinson, every kind of work tends to fill the time we set aside for it, like air fills every corner of a room — location: [2625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2625) ^ref-34375

The goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects. If we manage to establish a routine in this first step, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turn these findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in the slip-box. — location: [2680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2680) ^ref-19262
