## Highlights

To build wealth it didn’t matter when you bought U.S. stocks, just that you bought them and kept buying them. It didn’t matter if valuations were high or low. It didn’t matter if you were in a bull market or a bear market. All that mattered was that you kept buying. — location: [105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=105) ^ref-64554

Make it a habit to invest your money like you make it a habit to pay your rent or mortgage. Buy investments like you buy food—do it often. — location: [114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=114) ^ref-61668

---
If you don’t have much money invested, then you should focus on increasing your savings (and investing it). However, if you already have a sizable portfolio, then you should spend more time thinking about the details of your investment plan. — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=172) ^ref-32186

First, figure out how much you expect to comfortably save in the next year. — location: [183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=183) ^ref-28852

Next, determine how much you expect your investments to grow in the next year (in — location: [186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=186) ^ref-35359

---
If your expected savings are higher, then you need to focus more on saving money and adding to your investments. However, if your expected investment growth is higher, then spend more time thinking about how to invest what you already have. If the numbers are close to each other, then you should spend time on both. — location: [190](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=190) ^ref-6443

When we have the ability to save more, we should save more—and when we don’t, we should — location: [258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=258) ^ref-21183

save less. We shouldn’t use static, unchanging rules because our finances are rarely static and unchanging. — location: [258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=258) ^ref-57978

---
This is why the best savings advice is: save what you can. If you follow this advice, you will experience far less stress and far more overall happiness. — location: [263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=263) ^ref-37628

---
“The negative effects of stress outweigh the positive effects of income or health in general.” — location: [273](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=273) ^ref-23386

---
This implies that saving more is only beneficial if you can do it in a stress-free way. Otherwise, you will likely do yourself more harm than good. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=275) ^ref-35762

Similar to the effect of exercise on weight loss, cutting spending seems to have inherent limitations when it comes to saving more money. — location: [414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=414) ^ref-29202

Increases in income aren’t followed by similar increases in spending. — location: [442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=442) ^ref-49313

diminishing marginal utility. This is a jargonistic phrase, but its meaning is simple. It means that each additional unit of consumption brings about less benefit than the unit before it. — location: [452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=452) ^ref-58962

Their paper clearly illustrates that many poor people stay poor not because of their talent/motivation, but because they are in low-paying jobs that they must work to survive. — location: [489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=489) ^ref-49325

The most consistent way to get rich is to grow your income and invest in income-producing assets. — location: [506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=506) ^ref-4651

If you want to save more, the main point is to tighten up where you can, then focus on increasing your income. — location: [509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=509) ^ref-64738

---
Therefore, if you need to make more money, consider selling more of your time, or your expertise. — location: [525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=525) ^ref-40081

---
The only downside to selling your time is that it doesn’t scale. One hour of work will always equal one hour of income. — location: [528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=528) ^ref-54331

---
Unfortunately, similar to selling your time, selling an individual skill or service doesn’t scale. You have to do the work for each service delivered. — location: [542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=542) ^ref-59212

---
While a 9 to 5 will rarely make you filthy rich, learning how to work well with people and developing your skills can be one of the best things for your career development. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=587) ^ref-46220

---
Yes, selling your time, skills, or products is great and all, but it shouldn’t be the end goal of your wealth-building journey. The end goal should be ownership—using your additional income to acquire more income-producing assets. — location: [609](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=609) ^ref-35390

Ultimately, you are the one that must figure out what you want out of life. Once you do, then spend your money accordingly. — location: [752](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=752) ^ref-58387

Lifestyle creep is when someone increases their spending after experiencing an increase in income or as a way of keeping up with their peers. — location: [784](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=784) ^ref-5712

---
How much lifestyle creep can you afford? Technically it varies based on your savings rate, but for most people the answer is around 50%. — location: [795](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=795) ^ref-34409

---
More importantly, saving 50% of your raises is easy to implement and remember. Half is for you and half is for future you (in retirement). Coincidentally, this idea is similar to The 2x Rule I wrote about in the prior chapter when discussing how to spend money without feeling guilty. — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=888) ^ref-61826

This will be roughly equivalent to a 40-year payment stream discount by 4% per year. I prefer this shortcut because you can now do the math in your head.

It is this highly volatile nature of stocks that makes them difficult to hold during turbulent times. — location: [1771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1771) ^ref-63720

The best way to combat such emotional volatility is to focus on the long term. — location: [1773](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1773) ^ref-53460

but mainly because index funds are an easy way to get cheap diversification. — location: [1779](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1779) ^ref-10016

Bonds should act as a diversifying asset, not a risk asset. — location: [1817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1817) ^ref-27775

During market sell-offs, bonds are one of the only assets that tend to rise while everything else is falling. — location: [1825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1825) ^ref-29447

Pros: Lower volatility. Good for rebalancing. Safety of principal. — location: [1856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1856) ^ref-19875

Pros: Real estate exposure that you don’t have to manage. Less correlated with stocks during good times. — location: [1933](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1933) ^ref-63576

Cons: Volatility greater than or equal to stocks. Less liquidity for non-traded REITs. Highly correlated with stocks and other risk assets during stock market crashes. — location: [1935](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=1935) ^ref-64437

As a result, the best market timing approach is to invest your money as soon as you can. This isn’t just an opinion of mine either.

As you can see, Average-In underperformed Buy Now by 2%-4%, on average, over 12 months for most assets and in 60%–80% of all starting months. — location: [2433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2433) ^ref-58839

Isn’t it riskier to Buy Now than to Average-In? The answer is a resounding “Yes!” — location: [2439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2439) ^ref-54879

The problem is that severe market declines don’t happen too often. In U.S. market history severe dips have only taken place in the 1930s, 1970s, and 2000s. That’s rare. This means that Buy the Dip only has a small chance of beating DCA. — location: [2575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2575) ^ref-45701

Because while you wait for your beloved dip, you may find that it never comes. As a result, you end up missing out on months (or more) of compound growth as the market keeps rising and leaves you behind. — location: [2642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2642) ^ref-6276

The only good news here is that, over 30-year periods, the differences in annualized returns are far less pronounced. — location: [2723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2723) ^ref-31414

As a result, the importance of your future returns increases as you add more money. This means that, after adding funds, a negative return will cost you more in absolute dollar terms than if that negative return had occurred before you added those funds. — location: [2745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=2745) ^ref-39833

We have the ability to diversify. We can diversify what assets we own and we can diversify when we own them.

As Friedrich Neitzsche once said, “Ignore the past and you will lose an eye. Live in the past and you will lose both.” Knowing history is important, but obsessing over it can lead us astray.

Because selling forces you to face off against two of the strongest behavioral biases in the investment world—fear of missing out on the upside and the fear of losing money on the downside. — location: [3069](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3069) ^ref-64417

To rebalance. To get out of a concentrated (or losing) position. To meet your financial needs. — location: [3076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3076) ^ref-22522

Since markets tend to go up over time, the optimal thing to do is to sell as late as possible. Therefore, selling over time (or as late as possible) is usually better than selling right away. — location: [3086](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3086) ^ref-41747

---
From this simple fact we can then infer that the portfolio that never rebalances generally outperforms the one that rebalances annually. Why? Because nearly every time you rebalance you usually end up selling a higher-growth asset (stocks) to buy a lower-growth asset (bonds). — location: [3117](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3117) ^ref-20289

From this plot we can see that, most of the time, rebalancing reduces risk by shifting money from your higher-volatility assets (stocks) to your lower-volatility assets (bonds). — location: [3139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3139) ^ref-46197

“The risk-adjusted returns are not meaningfully different whether a portfolio is rebalanced monthly, quarterly, or annually; however, the number of rebalancing events and resulting costs increase significantly.”94 — location: [3150](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3150) ^ref-32179

---
All of these analyses illustrate the same thing—it doesn’t matter when you rebalance, just that you do it on some periodic basis. As a result, I recommend an annual rebalance for two reasons: It takes less time. It coincides with our annual tax season. — location: [3157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3157) ^ref-32132

Whatever you decide to do when it comes to rebalancing frequency, avoiding unnecessary taxation is a must. This is why I don’t recommend rebalancing frequently in your taxable accounts (i.e., brokerage account).

While selling an asset to rebalance isn’t the worst thing in the world, there is a way to rebalance your portfolio that involves no tax consequences at all—Just Keep Buying. That’s right. You can buy your way back into a rebalanced portfolio. I call this an accumulation rebalance because you are rebalancing by buying your most underweight asset over time. — location: [3174](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3174) ^ref-38663

If you sell it all right away and it goes up 10x, you will feel far worse than if you sell 95% of it and the remaining 5% goes to $0.

And don’t mix up a period of underperformance with a losing position. Every asset class goes through periods of underperformance, so you shouldn’t use these periods as an excuse to sell. — location: [3225](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3225) ^ref-35202

As a reminder, a 401(k)—also called a traditional 401(k)—is funded with pre-tax money while a Roth 401(k) is funded with post-tax money. The only difference between these account types is when you decide to pay your taxes. — location: [3295](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3295) ^ref-373

---
Will your effective income tax rate be higher now (while working) or later (in retirement)? All else equal, if you think your income taxes will be higher now, then contribute to a traditional 401(k), otherwise contribute to a Roth 401(k). — location: [3323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3323) ^ref-58804

---
Though there are a few scenarios where a Roth 401(k) would be preferred to a traditional 401(k), I generally prefer the traditional 401(k). Why? Because it has one thing that a Roth doesn’t have—optionality. — location: [3350](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3350) ^ref-24342

---
This is why it probably doesn’t make sense to contribute to a Roth 401(k) while living in a high tax area like New York City, unless you know you are going to retire in an area with similarly high taxes. — location: [3363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3363) ^ref-59792

---
Despite the lack of optionality in a Roth 401(k), there are a few special cases where a Roth might be the way to go. One of these cases is for people who are high savers. — location: [3375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3375) ^ref-2956

---
This simple example demonstrates that the Roth 401(k) is probably the better choice for high savers, as you get more total tax-deferred benefits. — location: [3385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3385) ^ref-60364

---
I ask this question because I feel like I made a financial mistake by contributing too much to my 401(k) when I was younger. While my retirement projections look great now, I also placed some limits on what I can do with my money. — location: [3475](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3475) ^ref-4509

---
Ultimately, the decision to max out your 401(k) will be dependent on your individual circumstances. Factors such as your temperament, financial goals, and the cost of your employer’s 401(k) plan will all play a role in this decision. Make sure you have considered these factors carefully before moving forward. — location: [3489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3489) ^ref-57253

In fact, if you want to maximize your after-tax wealth, then you should put your highest-growth assets in tax-sheltered accounts (e.g., 401k, IRA, etc.) and your lowest-growth assets in taxable accounts. — location: [3503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3503) ^ref-62274

---
This example illustrates why you need to consider the expected growth rate of your assets in addition to the tax rates on income/capital gains before making an asset location decision. Additionally, by placing your high-growth (and likely higher-risk) assets into a nontaxable account, you may be less tempted to sell them during a market crash because they are harder to access. — location: [3512](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FYHZXBN&location=3512) ^ref-41199

This is why time is, and always will be, your most important asset. How you use that time in your 20s, 30s, and 40s will have huge impacts on your life in your 50s, 60s, and 70s.
