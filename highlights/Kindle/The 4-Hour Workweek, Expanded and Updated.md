## Highlights

But, isn’t pushing people out of the ring pushing the boundaries of ethics? Not at all—it’s no more than doing the uncommon within the rules. — location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=546) ^ref-40142

Rules are not ethics, rules are the lower bounds like laws, ethics are often above rules that people abide holding themselves to highestest standards. For any fan of chinese martial arts and of Wulin, this is cringe as fork.

Different is better when it is more effective or more fun. — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=563) ^ref-8264

Less ethical and more cringe? Hell no

If I simply made all my calls from 8:00–8:30 A.M. and 6:00–6:30 P.M., for a total of one hour, I was able to avoid secretaries and book more than twice as many meetings as the senior sales executives who called from 9–5. In other words, I got twice the results for ⅛ the time. — location: [566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=566) ^ref-3843

How much of this is still true in a society that respects work-life balance. If someone is calling me during those times unexpectedly, I would at least consider them rude.

Retirement planning is like life insurance. — location: [573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=573) ^ref-13661

Retriement is not the end goal of life planning, it should be an artifact.

The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up all the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. “Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually,” just do it and correct course along the way. — location: [610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=610) ^ref-31176

It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair. — location: [623](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=623) ^ref-54608

Too extreme

Distress refers to harmful stimuli that makes you weaker, less confident, and less able. Destructive criticism, abusive bosses, and smashing your face on a curb are examples of this. These are things we want to avoid. Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for “healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth. — location: [663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=663) ^ref-40509

What is the difference between motivation and eustress?
