## Highlights

When a trio of psychologists conducted a comprehensive review of thirty-three studies, they found that in every one, the majority of answer revisions were from wrong to right. This phenomenon is known as the first-instinct fallacy. — location: [112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=112) ^ref-40335

We hesitate at the very idea of rethinking. Take an experiment where hundreds of college students were randomly assigned to learn about the first-instinct fallacy. The speaker taught them about the value of changing their minds and gave them advice about when it made sense to do so. On their next two tests, they still weren’t any more likely to revise their answers. Part of the problem is cognitive laziness. Some psychologists point out that we’re mental misers: we often prefer the ease of hanging on to old views over the difficulty of grappling with new ones. Yet there are also deeper forces behind our resistance to rethinking. Questioning ourselves makes the world more unpredictable. It requires us to admit that the facts may have changed, that what was once right may now be wrong. Reconsidering something we believe deeply can threaten our identities, making it feel as if we’re losing a part of ourselves. — location: [120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=120) ^ref-26283

If you’re a firefighter, dropping your tools doesn’t just require you to unlearn habits and disregard instincts. Discarding your equipment means admitting failure and shedding part of your identity. You have to rethink your goal in your job—and your role in life. — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=172) ^ref-40535

Dropping one’s tools creates an existential crisis. Without my tools, who am I?” — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=175) ^ref-56858

---
Our ways of thinking become habits that can weigh us down, and we don’t bother to question them until it’s too late. Expecting your squeaky brakes to keep working until they finally fail on the freeway. Believing the stock market will keep going up after analysts warn of an impending real estate bubble. Assuming your marriage is fine despite your partner’s increasing emotional distance. Feeling secure in your job even though some of your colleagues have been laid off. — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=179) ^ref-61101

You may not carry an ax or a shovel, but you do have some cognitive tools that you use regularly. They might be things you know, assumptions you make, or opinions you hold. Some of them aren’t just part of your job—they’re part of your sense of self. — location: [185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=185) ^ref-10583

Our well-learned habit was to use online tools to connect with people far away; once we lived within walking distance on the same campus, we figured we no longer needed the e-group. — location: [196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=196) ^ref-27407

What if we were quicker to make amendments to our own mental constitutions? — location: [222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=222) ^ref-12866

Thinking again can help you generate new solutions to old problems and revisit old solutions to new problems. It’s a path to learning more from the people around you and living with fewer regrets. — location: [247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=247) ^ref-12426

---
Unfortunately, when it comes to our own knowledge and opinions, we often favor feeling right over being right. In everyday life, we make many diagnoses of our own, ranging from whom we hire to whom we marry. We need to develop the habit of forming our own second opinions. — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=297) ^ref-53367

---
we often slip into the mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians. In each of these modes, we take on a particular identity and use a distinct set of tools. We go into preacher mode when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy: we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals. We enter prosecutor mode when we recognize flaws in other people’s reasoning: we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. We shift into politician mode when we’re seeking to win over an audience: we campaign and lobby for the approval of our constituents. The risk is that we become so wrapped up in preaching that we’re right, prosecuting others who are wrong, and politicking for support that we don’t bother to rethink our own views. — location: [308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=308) ^ref-50662

---
We move into scientist mode when we’re searching for the truth: we run experiments to test hypotheses and discover knowledge. Scientific tools aren’t reserved for people with white coats and beakers, and using them doesn’t require toiling away for years with a microscope and a petri dish. Hypotheses have as much of a place in our lives as they do in the lab. Experiments can inform our daily decisions. — location: [330](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=330) ^ref-1570

---
Like careful scientists, they take their time so they have the flexibility to change their minds. I’m beginning to think decisiveness is overrated . . . but I reserve the right to change my mind. — location: [353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=353) ^ref-28698

Intelligence was no cure—it might have been more of a curse. — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=383) ^ref-61828

If intelligence is power, then this is very similar to the dictator trap where people are too overconfident in their power that they fail to see any hard truth.

No matter how much brainpower you have, if you lack the motivation to change your mind, you’ll miss many occasions to think again. Research reveals that the higher you score on an IQ test, the more likely you are to fall for stereotypes, because you’re faster at recognizing patterns. — location: [385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=385) ^ref-20488

This reminds me of the black swan theory. In both cases, we are so quick to draw a conclusion that we are more comfortable or familiar with.

And recent experiments suggest that the smarter you are, the more you might struggle to update your beliefs. — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=386) ^ref-36082

Yet if the empirical pattern clashes with your ideology, math prowess is no longer an asset; it actually becomes a liability. The better you are at crunching numbers, the more spectacularly you fail at analyzing patterns that contradict your views. If they were liberals, math geniuses did worse than their peers at evaluating evidence that gun bans failed. If they were conservatives, they did worse at assessing evidence that gun bans worked. — location: [392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=392) ^ref-4756

One is confirmation bias: seeing what we expect to see. The other is desirability bias: seeing what we want to see. — location: [396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=396) ^ref-28091

My favorite bias is the “I’m not biased” bias, in which people believe they’re more objective than others. It turns out that smart people are more likely to fall into this trap. — location: [400](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=400) ^ref-28234

Thinking like a scientist involves more than just reacting with an open mind. It means being actively open-minded. It requires searching for reasons why we might be wrong—not — location: [405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=405) ^ref-30836

After all, the purpose of learning isn’t to affirm our beliefs; it’s to evolve our beliefs. — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=417) ^ref-28040

If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom. — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=437) ^ref-38068

Research shows that when people are resistant to change, it helps to reinforce what will stay the same. Visions for change are more compelling when they include visions of continuity. Although our strategy might evolve, our identity will endure. — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=474) ^ref-16270

---
The curse of knowledge is that it closes our minds to what we don’t know. Good judgment depends on having the skill—and the will—to open our minds. — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=485) ^ref-56022

Anton’s syndrome—a deficit of self-awareness in which a person is oblivious to a physical disability but otherwise doing fairly well cognitively. — location: [520](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=520) ^ref-50706

---
We all have blind spots in our knowledge and opinions. The bad news is that they can leave us blind to our blindness, which gives us false confidence in our judgment and prevents us from rethinking. The good news is that with the right kind of confidence, we can learn to see ourselves more clearly and update our views. — location: [522](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=522) ^ref-29638

That’s the armchair quarterback syndrome, where confidence exceeds competence. — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=556) ^ref-35667

The opposite of armchair quarterback syndrome is impostor syndrome, where competence exceeds confidence. — location: [558](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=558) ^ref-29902
