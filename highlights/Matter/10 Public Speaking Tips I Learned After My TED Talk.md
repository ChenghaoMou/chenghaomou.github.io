title: "10 Public Speaking Tips I Learned After My TED Talk"
---

## Highlights
<mark>You should only include what is necessary to make the audience follow what you're saying. Don't include sentences, use graphics to enhance the experience, make it visually appealing and do not write paragraphs!</mark>

<mark>As a speaker, it's natural to want to include as much as possible in your talk to increase its value. However, this is a terrible mistake. With each section, imagine if you could only use one sentence to convey the point; focus on that and eliminate the rest.</mark>

<mark>What many ignore is how they finish their sentences. I also used to confidently begin my sentences but get quieter as I progressed. Ending your sentences with a firm tone will make your talk considerably more memorable.</mark>

<mark>I understand how long one-second pauses can feel on stage; however, maintaining a slow pace and pausing at the right moments can significantly enhance your talk.</mark>

<mark>Retaining information while listening to someone is not easy, especially given the declining attention spans among younger generations. You must give your audience a chance to process your statements before you move on.</mark>

<mark>Your audience will not want to listen to you for 10 minutes to save them the hassle of a Google search. Base your talk on your personal experiences and provide a unique angle.</mark>

<mark>Learn the art of engaging your audience with gestures, movements and facial expressions.</mark>

<mark>Although this is a hard habit to break, avoid using "filler" words when you speak. Train yourself to be comfortable with pausing when necessary. It will make you appear more competent and comfortable, which makes it more likely for your audience to pay attention.</mark>

<mark>You shouldn't read off anything during your talk, even small flash cards. It lowers the quality of your talk. There is just a different feel when a speaker genuinely understands his talk and delivers it as if it's a regular conversation. You have to structure your talk in a way where each sentence reminds you of the one after so that even if you were to talk without preparation, you would still follow the same order.</mark>

<mark>I don't mean to alarm you, but in my experience, audiences tend to be more alert to a speaker's flaws than their strengths. If you come across as boring or arrogant, the audience will likely discard your talk immediately, even if it's actually good. Be humble, friendly and engaging. If the audience can relate to you, they will be far more inclined to listen to you.</mark>

<mark>As much as you hate to face the fact as a speaker, people have narrow attention spans. They will probably not remember much of your talk. So, use strong statements that provide a takeaway from your talk, even if the supporting sentences aren't present.</mark>
