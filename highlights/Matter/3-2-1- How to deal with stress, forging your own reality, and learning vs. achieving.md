## Highlights
> "Think about the little things you enjoy, then turn around and do them for someone else. If you feel relief when someone asks a question in class, then other students are probably relieved too. Be the one who asks. If you love it when a friend calls to check in, your friends probably love it too. Be the one who calls. If it makes your whole day when someone compliments your outfit, other people probably love it too. Give out more compliments."

> Author Francois de La Rochefoucauld reminds us that we often justify our mistakes rather than addressing them: "We try to make virtues out of the faults we have no wish to correct."
