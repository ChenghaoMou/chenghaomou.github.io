## Highlights

> "Two is twice as good as one, but one is infinitely better than zero. * One minute of making sales calls is infinitely better than zero minutes. * One minute of meditation is infinitely better than zero minutes. * One minute of writing is infinitely better than zero minutes. Sure, it might be ideal to spend an hour doing these things, but one minute gets you in the game. Now you're learning. Now you're improving. Now results are possible. Onedoesn't seem like much, but it's something real. At zero, you're still dreaming."
