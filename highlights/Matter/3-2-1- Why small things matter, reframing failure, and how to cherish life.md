## Highlights
> “Life rewards action, not intelligence. Many brilliant people talk themselves out of getting started, and being smart doesn't help very much without the courage to act.

> Priorities do shift, and you can change them at any time, but simply getting them down in black and white adds clarity to your life, and clarity creates energy.”

> Every time you do something that is one less time you do it. One day you will do something the final time and you will rarely know when that day comes.
