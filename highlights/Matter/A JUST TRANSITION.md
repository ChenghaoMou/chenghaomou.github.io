> extractivism, the siphoning of raw materials from the Global South, and an uncomfortably tight entanglement with the fossil fuel industry. Where Big Tech’s claims to be green refer to real renewables not dodgy carbon offsets, it’s because they’re diverting the available renewable energy sources away from communities. Even capturing big chunks of the electricity grid isn’t enough, and the talk now is of nuclear reactors and nuclear fusion. Meanwhile, diminishing water sources are denuded and the demand for more chips is dependent on conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
