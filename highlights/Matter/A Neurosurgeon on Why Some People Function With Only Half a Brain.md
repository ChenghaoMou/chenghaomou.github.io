## Highlights
<mark>That’s typical neuroscience gibberish. The fact is that neuroscientists study the brain using network theory, and… surprise!… the brain seems to be a network. The ancient Greeks studied the brain according to caloric theory, and… surprise!… the brain seemed to be a heat generator. The 19th century physiologists studied the brain using mechanical concepts and… surprise!… the brain seemed like a machine. Quantum physicists (e.g. Roger Penrose) study the brain as a quantum system and… surprise!… it looks like a quantum system! Werner Heisenberg was that rare scientist who was a capable philosopher, and he understood this silliness very well. He said (one of my favorite quotes in science): “What we observe is not nature itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning.” – Werner Heisenberg, Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (1958) The most important thing in science is not the answer you get but the question you ask. If you study the brain using computational models, it will look like a computer. If you study the brain using models of biochemistry, it will look like a chemistry set. If you study the brain using electrical circuit models, it will look like an electrical circuit. We only see nature when it is exposed to our method of questioning.</mark>

<mark>My computer is a network and has redundancy. But if I cut it in half with a chainsaw it sure as hell won’t work. Neuroscientists are just making stuff up. It’s confabulation, not science.</mark>

<mark>The diseased hemisphere was never particularly functional anyway, and brain function in the healthy hemisphere was probably adequate for many years prior to the surgery.</mark>

<mark>My problem with the “redundancy” argument is that it assumes that the brain generates the mind via its “parallel recursive” nature or whatever, which is not only a leap beyond what is really known in the science, but is metaphysical gibberish. There is no metaphysical understanding of matter in the materialist framework that can even begin to explain mind function in terms of brain function. So it is hopeless to attempt to explain mind preservation as “parallel recursive” circuits or whatever. It’s just invoking magic.</mark>

<mark>We don’t know (from a materialist perspective) how it is even possible for the brain to relate to the mind, so how could we possibly know how mind is preserved after brain surgery? It’s just confabulation dressed up to look like science.</mark>
