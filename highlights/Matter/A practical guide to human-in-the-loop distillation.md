## Highlights

> An alternative approach (right) is to make multiple passes over the data and annotate sentiment for one aspect at a time. While this seems like it creates more work for the human, experiments have shown that this approach can actually be significantly faster than annotating all categories at the same time, as it helps the annotator focus and lets them move through the examples much quicker. (Also see the S&P Global case study for a 10Ã— increase in data development speed by annotating labels individually.)
