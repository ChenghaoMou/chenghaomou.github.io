## Highlights
<mark>So, let’s talk about informed consent for a minute, in the context of medical research. “Informed consent” means that the subject of the research is aware of what is going on, about the risks and rewards, about the uses their data will be put to, and agrees to participate. Sometimes, particularly in psychological research, the experiment becomes impossible if the subjects know everything that’s going on. In these cases, incomplete disclosure or even active deception is required. Researchers who would use such methods have a “special burden of responsibility” to ensure that the deception is justified and that their subjects’ rights are being protected; stringent ethical review is required.</mark>
