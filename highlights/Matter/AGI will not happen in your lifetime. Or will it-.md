## Highlights
> In the spirit of full disclosure, I have to admit that I, being a historian of computing, have a rather jaded and cynical view of the hyperbolic optimism of our field and as such am somewhat conditioned to be a contrarian when it comes to predictions such as this. Take the singularity, for example, something that von Neuman first spoke of in the 1950s and which certain of our colleagues have predicted with alarming precision that we'd achieve by 2045. The term is sufficiently imprecise, filled with emotional and historic baggage, and touches some of humanity's deepest hopes and fears that it's hard to have a rational discussion therein. AGI is just like this. Greek mythology speaks of golums created from clay; Mary Shelly built life from human parts whose very souls were ignited by lightning; da Vinci imagined mechanical knights to fight wars; Edison built dolls that moved and talked; Weiner - who coined the term cybernetics - thought we might build artifical intelligenes through analog mechanisms, Simon and Newll thought it so through formal logic, Feigenbaum through knowlege engineering, and now we see our colleagues who expect that AGI is right around the corner if and only we had enough data and a level built of enough GPUs such that we could move the world.

> In short, AGI seems just around the corner, and you yourself fall into that trap when you say "it's now mostly a matter of software". It's never just a matter of software. Just ask Elon and his full self driving vehicle, or the Air Force and the software-intensive infrastructure of the F-17, or the IRS with their crushing technical debt. I have studied many of the cognitive architectures that are proported to be on the path of AGI: SOAR, Sigma, ACT-R, MANIC, AlphaX and its variations, ChatGPT, Yann's latest work, and as you know have dabbled in one myself (Self, an architecture that combines the ideas of Minsky's society of mind, Rod's subsumption architecture, and Hofstadter's strange loops). In all of these cases, we all think we grok the right architecture, the right significant design decisions, but there is so much more to do. Heck, we've mapped the entire neural network of the common worm, and yet we don't see armies of armored artificial worms with laser beams taking over the world. With ever step we move forward, we discover things we did not know we needed to know. It took evolution about 300 million years to move from the first organic neurons to where we are today, and I don't think we can compress the remaining software problems associated with AGI in the next few decades.

> Indeed, this leads me to also observe, in the spirit of full disclosure, to suggest that we as computer scientists not only vastly overestimate our abilities to create an AGI, we vastly underestimate and underrepresent what behavioral scientists, psychologists, cognitive scientists, neurologists, social scientists, and even the poets, philosophers and storytellers of the world know about what it means to be human. There is much we can and should learn from them to guide our work as computer scientists in our journey.

> I quoted the late Drew McDermott’s closely-related line: “It is hard to know where [AI researchers] have gone wronger: in underestimating language or overestimating computer programs”

> Ideas are hard to predict; we don’t know when they will come, and we don’t know how many genuinely new, important ideas we need; on the machine-interpretable knowledge front, we have problems too.

> And I’ve been concerned for a long time that a fixation on Big Data has sucked the oxygen (as Emily Bender likes to put it) from a lot of other ideas that might be better. For another, I don’t really feel like that many people are working on the right problems right now, and I think a lot of core problems from 75 years ago are still unsolved; McCarthy worried about common sense in 1959, and I still don’t see a solution I can take all that seriously.

> We as a species are ill-prepared to properly metabolize such a superior intelligence, and the ethical issues of how we humans and these artificial sentient beings should treat one another are far beyond the capacity of earth's societies and governments to address with any degree of wisdom or dignity (stares at the US House of Representatives). What power and rights would we individuals have in the shadow of any metacorporation who would undoubly have been the one to bring such a creation into being at scale? Would we treat these new minds as literal slaves? How would this further divide the rich and the poor of this world?

> AGI is a term that has considerable emotional and historic baggage and as such - much like the term "singularity" - is often best used for selling books (stares at Ray) or for naming clickbait articles. It's complex, but I will assert that the mind is computable and therefore it is concievable that synthetic minds can be formed, minds that exhibit the behavior of organic ones.

> An aside: we must remember in all this that we humans live in a Flatland, and so we have considerable human bias when it comes to the semantics of intelligence. I therefore assert that it is concievable that other kinds of intelligence can be found in the cosmos.

> Indeed, Alan Newell said something to this effect in 1990: "The question for me is how can the human mind occur in the physical universe. We now know that the world is governed by physics. We now understand the way biology nestles comfortably within that. The issue is how will the mind do that as well. The answer must have the details. I got to know how the gears clank and how the pistons go and all the rest of that detail. My question leads me down to worry about the architecture".

> To their peril. Already we have seen minor abuses; plagiarism, for example, will never be the same. Troll farms may well starting using it to create misinformation at unprecedented scale; we can also expect more and circles of fake web sites in order to sell advertisements; ChatGPT been apparently used to create malware, and it has already infected journalism, with CNET using it produce news stories that were filled with errors. Bias is likely to be huge issue, too. Even if large models never acquire a volition of their own (I hope not!), we have already seen that in the wrong hands (either with malice or, as in the case of CNET, negligence), bad things can and probably will happen.

> I don’t leave my kids moral development to chance, and it terrifies me that so much of current AI is dependent on random details of training corpora that are not available to scientists for inquiry. This seems like a really bad idea.)

> This is why these things cannot be left up to us technologists; we should be only one voice in this journey, for what we are doing has the potential to change civilization.
