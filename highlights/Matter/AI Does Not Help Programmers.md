## Highlights
<mark>Fascinating as they are, AI assistants are not works of logic; they are works of words. Large language models: smooth talkers (like the ones who got all the dates in high school). They have become incredibly good at producing text that looks right. For many applications that is enough. Not for programming.</mark>

<mark>At this point, I did not even try to determine whether that newest version is correct; any competent programmer knows that spotting cases that do not work and adding a specific fix for each is not the best path to a correct program.</mark>
