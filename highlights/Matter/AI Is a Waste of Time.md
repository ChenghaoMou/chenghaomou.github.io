title: AI Is a Waste of Time

## Highlights
> What’s harder to model is the way that new technology—especially communications technology—might simultaneously save time and waste time, making us, paradoxically, both more and less productive. I used my laptop to research and write this article, and to procrastinate the writing of this article. The smartphone’s productivity-enhancing potential is obvious, and so is its productivity-destroying potential: The typical 20-something spends roughly seven hours a day on their phone, including more than five hours on social media, watching videos, or gaming.

> In 1994, the economists Sue Bowden and Avner Offer studied how various 20th-century technologies had spread among households. They concluded that “time using” technologies (for example, TV and radio) diffused faster than “time saving” technologies (vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, washing machines).

> Consumers will go to great lengths to escape the psychic burdens of sensory inactivity. Mid-century buyers got a radio, then a black-and-white TV, then a color TV, then a speaker system, then a VCR, and so on, sending an unmistakable signal to the producers of these machines that they had a nearly infinite demand for “higher doses of arousal per unit of time.”
