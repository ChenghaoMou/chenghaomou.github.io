## Highlights
<mark>In 2021, Twitter introduced a feature prompting users to consider reading news articles before retweeting them. Through their link tracking, they’d found that an overwhelming number of users would repost articles without having even visted the url. Talking heads would often link to articles in a post offering their own commentary, which in many cases would not match up to the content of the piece. So long as the headline could be interpreted in a way that fed into the reader’s emotions or biases, it didn’t matter what the body of the article actually said. News articles had become nothing more than pseudo-citations to back up pretty much any point you wanted to make at all.</mark>
