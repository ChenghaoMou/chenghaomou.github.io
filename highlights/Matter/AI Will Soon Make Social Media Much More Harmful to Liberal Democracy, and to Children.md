## Highlights
<mark>Most of us thought that it was inherently good to just connect everybody and everything. But now I can see that even though most people are good––or, at least, they behave well when interacting with strangers––a small number of trolls, foreign agents, and domestic jerks gain access to the megaphone that is social media, and they can do a lot of damage to trust, truth, and civility.</mark>

<mark>But as political polarization rose steadily, not just in the USA but in many parts of the world in the 2010s, we discovered that issues of partisanship, identity, and us-versus-them were among the most powerful drivers of engagement.</mark>

<mark>1) AI-enhanced social media will wash ever-larger torrents of garbage into our public conversation. 2) Personalized super-influencers will make it much easier for companies, criminals, and foreign agents to influence us to do their bidding via social media platforms. 3) AI will make social media much more addictive for children, thereby accelerating the ongoing teen mental illness epidemic. 4) AI will change social media in ways that strengthen authoritarian regimes (particularly China) and weaken liberal democracies, particularly polarized ones, such as the USA.</mark>

<mark>1. Authenticate all users, including bots 2. Mark AI-generated audio and visual content 3. Require data transparency with users, government officials, and researchers 4. Clarify that platforms can sometimes be liable for the choices they make and the content they promote 5. Raise the age of “internet adulthood” to 16 and enforce it</mark>
