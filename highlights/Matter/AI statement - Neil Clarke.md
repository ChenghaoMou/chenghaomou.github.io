## Highlights
<mark>We believe that AI technologies will likely create significant breakthroughs in a wide range of fields, but that those gains should be earned through the ethical use and acquisition of data.</mark>

<mark>We believe that detection and detection-avoidance will be locked in a never-ending struggle similar to that seen in computer virus and anti-virus development, but that it is critically important that detection not continue to be downplayed or treated as a lesser priority than the development of new or improved LLMs.</mark>

<mark>We believe that submitting a work for consideration does not entitle a publisher or agent to use it in the training of AI technologies.</mark>

<mark>We believe that governments should craft meaningful legislation that both protects the rights of individuals, promotes the promise of this technology, and specifies consequences for those who seek to abuse it.</mark>

<mark>We believe that governments should be seeking advice on this legislation from a considerably wider range of people than just those who profit from this technology.</mark>
