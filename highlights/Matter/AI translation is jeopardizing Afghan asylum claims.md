## Highlights
<mark>“[Machine translation] doesn’t have a cultural awareness. Especially if you’re doing things like a personal statement that’s handwritten by someone,” Damian Harris-Hernandez, co-founder of the Refugee Translation Project, told Rest of World. “The person might not be perfect at writing, and also might use metaphors, might use idioms, turns of phrases that if you take literally, don’t make any sense at all.”</mark>

<mark>When machine translation is used to draft these documents, cultural blind spots and failures to understand regional colloquialisms can introduce inaccuracies. These errors can compromise claims in the rigorous review so many Afghan refugees experience.</mark>
