## Highlights

> It was remarkable to see how many errors could be stuffed into 5 minutes of vacuous conversation. What was even more striking was that the errors systematically pointed in a particular direction. In every instance, the model took an argument that was at least notionally surprising, and yanked it hard in the direction of banality. A moderately unusual argument about tariffs and sanctions (it got into the FT after all) was replaced by the generic criticism of sanctions that everyone makes. And so on for everything else. The large model had a lot of gaps to fill, and it filled those gaps with maximally unsurprising content.

> This is something that is hardwired into the technology. The more unusual a cultural feature is, the less likely it is to feature prominently in a large modelâ€™s representation of the culture. Notoriously, human peer reviewers too are often unwilling to recognize novel contributions. But they regularly at least recognize that these claims are novel, even if they frequently damn and blast them for their purported irrelevance and stupidity. Large models, instead, are more likely to quietly and simply strain them out.
