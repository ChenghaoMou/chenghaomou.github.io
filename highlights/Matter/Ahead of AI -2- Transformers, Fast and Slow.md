## Highlights
<mark>So, ignoring resources doesn’t mean you were lazy or missing out, but that we are defining your priorities and doing the most important stuff.</mark>

<mark>How I avoid the fear of missing out is to make lists. I have a list of each major category that I find interesting. And there are a lot of categories that are interesting!</mark>

<mark>The internet is amazing. There is so much cool stuff out there. But the bitter truth is we can’t consume it all. This is particularly true for the machine learning field, which is moving too fast and has way too many interesting subcategories: Activation functions, autoML, calibration, causal inference, CNN architectures …</mark>

<mark>In each list, I collect interesting books, research articles, blog posts, videos, Reddit discussions, and sometimes even Twitter threads. Do I read it all? No, keeping up with that would be a full-time job. And I only capture some of the interesting stuff. Typically, I only focus on resources that can help me learn something new (as opposed to building a broad knowledge base and recreating a personal Wikipedia).</mark>
