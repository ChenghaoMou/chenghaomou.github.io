## Highlights
> To be fair, an article such as the above can also be written and spread by a human. However, one of the arguments is that Galactica can lower the barrier-to-entry and amplify the scale of this issue. The arguments in favor and against Galactica are probably best summarized in Yann LeCun's (pro) and Michael Black's (con) Twitter threads.

> On the other hand, as a former moderator of the ArXiv machine learning category, I also share the concerns. Even though ArXiv doesn't conduct peer reviews, moderators already sacrifice their free time dealing with problematic articles uploaded to ArXiv every day. (Issues range from plagiarism to fake science.) The viewpoints may be too extreme on both sides. I am not against progress and believe there is room for compromise. For instance, progress is good, but the message and marketing behind large language models could be improved. For example, why not create an article template generator that researchers can use instead of developing systems that promise to write the entire article, including providing the facts?
