## Highlights
> “I think a lot of us who studied and worked for years to achieve our style and our signature process felt offended by the idea we would just become something like an Instagram filter for people to apply to their AI prompts,” Moore says via email. He was irritated because his studio’s hand-drawn animation — which lovingly nods to Art Nouveau and medieval art — was being reduced to a superficial “cheat code.” Moore’s view is shared by many professional illustrators and other artists who think that the rise of AI images, particularly within the past year, poses a creative invasion. “I feel like it’s a violation of the soul, to be honest,” says Sarah Andersen, the Oregon-based cartoonist (“Sarah’s Scribbles”) and best-selling author (“Fangs”). “My work, like every other artist, is informed by my lived experiences and my education and my life and therefore, it’s deeply personal.”

> Jason Chatfield, president of the National Cartoonists Society, says that many artists are primarily looking for credit, consent and compensation from AI art generation companies. He adds: “Legislators will take forever to even fathom the tech, let alone build in any guardrails, so it takes things like litigation and public debate to move the needle on the ethical use of this technology.”

> “The companies behind AI art generators have developed and deployed them in a way that is hostile to artists, such as by scraping training images without consent or compensation,” Narayanan says. “Allowing the tools to produce images in the style of a particular artist seems like a clear case of appropriating the labor and visual distinctness of an artist.” In Narayanan’s view, though, it didn’t have to be this way. “The developers could have treated artists as partners and stakeholders, rather than raw material to train on,” he says. “Those who claim it was inevitable are simply making excuses for the failure of companies to develop the tech responsibly.”

> “It doesn’t vomit up art by any definition of the word that means anything to me,” McKean says of AI text-to-image software. “Art, for me, is a process — it’s not just about the end result. Making something involves intent, context, story, journey, testing yourself, growing. … The arrival is the least important part of the experience.” So although AI can produce a “technically astonishing tsunami” of images, McKean says, he began to dive into the text-to-image generation and soon felt a distressing sensation — that in this space, individual human creativity is meaningless. “If everyone can draw like Michelangelo,” he says, “there is no Michelangelo.”
