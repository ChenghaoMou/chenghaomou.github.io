## Highlights

> The common case is that you can’t measure what you want to measure, you can only measure a proxy and in order to meaningfully interpret even that, you either need to run an experiment that you probably don’t have the resources to run, or do statistics that you probably don’t have the expertise to do.

> Data has its place. It is a useful tool for making a certain class of persuasive arguments in certain domains. But do not worship it. Do not treat it as an end in itself. Stop going all googly-eyed (tee hee) at statistics. Metrics are tempting. They promise easy answers. Resist! Be skeptical! Have no tolerance for poor arguments made with data. Keep intrinsic motivation alive.
