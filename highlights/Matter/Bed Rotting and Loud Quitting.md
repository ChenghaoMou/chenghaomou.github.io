<mark>But they don’t necessarily take pleasure in making profits that disproportionately benefit people who are already rich. They’re not super psyched for another day of fucking up the planet in the name of defending big oil interests. They’re not pumped to break down their bodies for Jeff Bezos. And they don’t see the capacity to work hard as indicative of moral fortitude — a dismantling that owes a whole lot to disability justice.</mark>

<mark>They also see how working all the time robs you of your capacity for much else: for community, sure, but also for doing what you actually want to do. The only viable solution is extended, mindless rest.</mark>

<mark>The grossness is the point — because, as O’Sullivan argues, it points to the bleak dichotomy of contemporary capitalistic life, in which you are either “an active member of society” or “decaying at home,” and we all know it’s a moral failure to be gross, to decay, to “not get ready,” to “let yourself go.”</mark>
