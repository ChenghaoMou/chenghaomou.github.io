## Highlights
> Dutch, for example, is spoken as a first language by just over 20 million people, similar to Amharic. Yet Dutch appears almost 700 times more in the Common Crawl dataset, and hundreds of times more than even Hindi with its over 300 million native speakers.

> "We've shown that you can build useful models by using small, carefully curated data sets," said Asmelash Teka Hadgu. "We understand its limitations and capabilities. Meanwhile, Microsoft or Google usually build a single, gigantic model for all languages, so it's almost impossible to audit."

> "Talent is everywhere, opportunity is not," said Asmelash Teka Hadgu. "If you want to create the best kind of machine translation technology, say, for a Ghanaian language, there will be a Ghanaian who feels passionately and can do it well. Let's empower that."
