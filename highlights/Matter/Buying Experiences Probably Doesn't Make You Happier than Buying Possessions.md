## Highlights
<mark>Isn’t this proof that experiential purchases do make people happier? No. It’s proof that people recall them slightly more positively when prompted by a brief inquiry. This is not the same thing, at all.</mark>

<mark>Conceivably, this small but significant improvement of many sunny walks could dwarf the dinner in terms of overall enjoyment, but it certainly won’t be as memorable. Thus, the happiness granted by the shoes will be less apparent to the remembering self.</mark>

<mark>So we should expect there to be a huge bias towards experiences when asked about whether they make us happier than possessions. But we shouldn’t expect it to reflect the reality of which actually contributes more, in total, to our happiness. We also shouldn’t really expect to be able to measure that in any accurate way—at least not without a tool much more sophisticated than a brief survey.</mark>

<mark>People often don’t consider their opinions carefully until you ask questions that prompt reflection.</mark>

<mark>In other words, accumulating possessions can give you access to new kinds of experiences, even if any individual purchase doesn’t itself create a novel memory.</mark>

<mark>And they find that “experiential possessions” purchases result in the same reported satisfaction as experience purchases.</mark>

<mark>And it found that the “material buyer” group saw no happiness benefits from making experiential purchases.This is one survey, sure.</mark>

<mark>I guess it should go something like, “try to buy experiences instead of possessions, or maybe buy possessions that enrich your life by enabling novel experiences, or, if you’re the kind of person who tends to buy possessions over experiences, ignore us, we wouldn’t dare make broad generalities and purport to know better than you do about what makes you happy based on a couple of surveys, happiness is way too complicated for that.”</mark>

<mark>Learn what you like, know that this is possible</mark>

<mark>Understand that both materialism and thrill-seeking can be dead ends</mark>

<mark>Remember that the experiencing self and the remembering self are different</mark>
