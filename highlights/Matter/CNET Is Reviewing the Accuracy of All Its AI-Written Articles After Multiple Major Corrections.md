title: CNET Is Reviewing the Accuracy of All Its AI-Written Articles After Multiple Major Corrections
---

## Highlights
> The tech media site has been forced to issue multiple, major corrections to a post published on CNET, created via ChatGPT, as first reported by Futurism. In one single AI-written explainer on compounding interest, there were at least five significant inaccuracies, which have now been amended. The errors were as follows, according to CNET’s hefty correction:

> And just like the outlet’s public acknowledgement of its use of AI only followed widespread criticism, CNET didn’t identify nor aim to fix all these inaccuracies noted on Tuesday, all on its own. The media outlet’s correction only came after Futurism directly alerted CNET to some of the errors, Futurism reported.

> Usually, when an editor approaches an article (particularly an explainer as basic as “What is Compound Interest”), it’s safe to assume that the writer has done their best to provide accurate information. But with AI, there is no intent, only the product. An editor evaluating an AI-generated text cannot assume anything, and instead has to take an exacting, critical eye to every phrase, world, and punctuation mark. It’s a different type of task from editing a person, and one people might not be well-equipped for, considering the degree of complete, unfailing attention it must take and the high volume CNET seems to be aiming for with its ChatGPT-produced stories.

> All of the articles published under the “CNET Money” byline are very general explainers with plain language questions as headlines. They are clearly optimized to take advantage of Google’s search algorithms, and to end up at the top of peoples’ results pages—drowning out existing content and capturing clicks. CNET, like Gizmodo and many other digital media sites, earns revenue from ads on its pages. The more clicks, the more money an advertiser pays for their miniature digital billboard(s).

> But from a journalistic viewpoint, AI-generation is a looming crisis, wherein accuracy becomes entirely secondary to SEO and volume. Click-based revenue doesn’t incentivize thorough reporting or well-put explanation. And in a world where AI-posts become an accepted norm, the computer will only know how to reward itself.
