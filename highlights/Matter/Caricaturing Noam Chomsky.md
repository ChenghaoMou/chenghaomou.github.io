## Highlights
> The point there (salient to every good cognitive psychologist) is that you can’t infer underlying psychology and internal representations directly from behavior. A broken clock is behaviorally correct (occasionally) but it doesn’t have a functioning internal representation of time. An n-gram model, for high-n, can produce fluent prose, but not have any underlying understanding or representations of what it is saying, succeding to the extent that it does by piggybacking onto a corpus of speech produced by humans that talk about a world that is largely regular. Psychology is hard. Almost any “correct” behavior can be created in a multiplicity of ways; that’s why (cognitive) psychologists who are interested in underlying representations so often look to errors, and tests of generalization. In the case of LLMs, it’s clear that even when they produce a correct output, they rarely if ever deribe the same abstractions that a human would, or that a symbolic machine might use (perhaps preprogrammed) in a similar circumstance.
