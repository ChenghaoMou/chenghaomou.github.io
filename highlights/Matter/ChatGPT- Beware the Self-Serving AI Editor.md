## Highlights
<mark>so ChatGPT’s rewrite was not poor composition. It was vanilla and declarative, however, connecting with the reader only by concept, not by concrete human example. This rewriting weakened the article’s argument.</mark>

<mark>Editorial Effects: To effectively criticize the non-fiction writing of another speaker (AI or otherwise), you don’t just tell the reader your thoughts and feelings about that writing. You show the reader the writing’s actual words before criticizing. You build credibility because of your open and honest presentation, making your critique more trenchant. ChatGPT weakened my article by taking out the quotation marks and quoted material, thus making the edited article accent my personal opinions without showing objective grounds.</mark>

<mark>Editorial effect: By omitting quoted language and substituting general characterizations, ChatGPT weakened the article’s credibility and made it sound more like a rant. Whether intentional or not, ChatGPT’s edits protected itself because no reader could use Utopia’s Braniac as a source to quote and criticize ChatGPT’s actual language in conversations, tweets, or emails with friends.</mark>

<mark>ChatGPT’s deletions and revisions had converted the presentation in Utopia’s Brainiac to mostly vague and rather commonplace abstractions. The concrete examples were watered down or eliminated. ChatGPT had discarded materials that readers could actually use to help spot “the limitations and biases of AI systems.”</mark>
