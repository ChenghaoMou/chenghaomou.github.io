## Highlights
> There’s a certain cruel irony in the fact that as the highest-profile technology in years makes its debut, the ones best suited to keep it on the rails are also the most precarious at the companies that need them. That’s no accident. A chatbot is a sort of magic trick; for the illusion to work properly, the assistants curled up inside the box must remain hidden from the audience, their contribution unremarked. While Google and Microsoft want you to forget that they exist, for the workers, forgetting doesn’t come so easily.

> It’s never been right. But with some of the world’s most profitable companies now poised to extend their dominance with a whole new business that would not exist without the toil of their lowest-paid workers, it’s high time that the ghosts in the machine show themselves, and get the recognition they’re due.
