## Highlights
<mark>Sociology, however, is not the study of the first glance, but the study of the second glance. And at second glance, questions and concerns come up. Should everything that is said be equally forced under the rod of comprehensibility? Should comprehensibility mean: Comprehensibility for everyone? Comprehensibility without any effort? Comprehensibility without any preparation, without any time spent thinking and deciding? Is there a linear continuum that leads from incomprehensibility to comprehensibility and along which one can demand more comprehensibility? Or are there also detours on this path from the incomprehensible to the comprehensible, for instance into the mis-comprehensible? Is it perhaps true that the incomprehensible can only be resolved by increasing comprehensibility and mis-comprehensibility at the same time?</mark>
