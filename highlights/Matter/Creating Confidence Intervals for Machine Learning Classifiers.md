## Highlights
<mark>Lastly, itâ€™s worth highlighting that the big picture is to measure and report uncertainty. Confidence intervals are one way to do that.</mark>

<mark>A confidence interval is a method that computes an upper and a lower bound around an estimated value. The actual parameter value is either insider or outside these bounds.</mark>

<mark>As a side-note, we can say that the difference of two measurements is statistically significant if confidence intervals do not overlap. However we cannot say that results are not statistically significant if confidence intervals overlap.</mark>
