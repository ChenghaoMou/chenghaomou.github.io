## Highlights

> It is easy to be cynical in this world. It takes effort to be genuine, to be positive. Seek to understand and not judge. Lex Fridman is a prime example of this. He talks about love all the time. I have been following him since the days of his podcast being called 'The Artificial Intelligence Podcast'. Yet the first time I saw comments under his posts I was shocked. Hate. Mockery. Cynicism. Welcome to the internet.
