## Highlights
<mark>I argued this at the time: “The truth is that while these systems perform well on specific language-processing tests, they can only take the test. None come anywhere close to matching humans in reading comprehension or other general abilities that the test was designed to measure.” Moreover, such systems lack the basic commonsense understanding of the world that is assumed of humans taking the same tests. In effect, I claimed, “Rather than being ready for high school or college, AI has a lot of growing to do before it’s even ready for preschool.”</mark>

<mark>But does an AI system’s performance on an exam actually predict that it will exhibit skills in the real world? Perhaps there is a correlation between how humans perform on tests and on their future skills in the real world, but that correlation has not been demonstrated for AI systems.</mark>

<mark>The fact that ChatGPT does well on one version of a problem does not mean that it has a humanlike understanding of the problem or that it will be able to solve similar (or even essentially identical) problems. Probing the system’s understanding requires much more than giving it a single version of a question.</mark>
