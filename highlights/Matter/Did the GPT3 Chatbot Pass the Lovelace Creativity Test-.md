## Highlights
<mark>GPT-3 was not trained to look at meaning. It does not understand its training data. Otherwise it would have learned from the instructional material it saw. GPT-3 does not learn. It rather does a fancy version of memorizing words and their positional relations. And make no mistake, the results are incredible.</mark>

<mark>And the creativity required to do the supplementary training of AI comes from humans. The AI itself is not creative.</mark>

<mark>In terms of simple math and self-referencing, GPT-3 flunks the Lovelace test.</mark>
