## Highlights

> Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is little more than a sci-fi dream of tech executives and engineers who grew up on those stories and desperately want to see them come to life. The acceptance of it, in my view, reveals a desire to place fantasy, if not faith, above reality, and to engage in the kind of wishful thinking that ultimately turned AI pioneer Joseph Weizenbaum against the technology for the rest of his life. As Weizenbaum once wrote, “Computers enable fantasies, many of them wonderful, but also those of people whose compulsion to play God overwhelms their ability to fathom the consequences of their attempt to turn their nightmares into reality.”

> Skeptics are not wrong to call out the problems with these companies, the flaws in the misleading narratives they spread about the technologies they deploy on the public, and the frequent failure of those who claim to be holding power to account to call things out for what they are. The problem is instead with a field of tech journalism that’s far too close to the people and companies they’re supposed to cover well to keep the rest of the public properly informed.
