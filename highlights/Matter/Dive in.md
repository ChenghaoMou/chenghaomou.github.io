> Similarly, the only method I know of for finding actual good plans is to take a bad plan and slam it into the world, to let evidence and the feedback impinge upon your strategy, and let the world tell you where the better ideas are.

> Your second plan doesn't need to be good or feasible either, of course --- the important thing is that you (1) start with a plan; (2) get out there and start operating; and (3) get better plans as you get more information.

> You're still going to need a lot of luck, and you need to be prepared for many of your plans not working. Also, don't get me wrong, it helps to start with a good/feasible plan. But "quality of the initial plan" is much less important than many people expect.
