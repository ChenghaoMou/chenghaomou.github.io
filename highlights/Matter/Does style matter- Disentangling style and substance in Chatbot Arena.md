## Highlights

> When controlling for length and style, we found noticeable shifts in the ranking. GPT-4o-mini and Grok-2-mini drop below most frontier models, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus, and Llama-3.1-405B rise substantially. In the Hard Prompt subset, Claude 3.5 Sonnet ties for #1 with chatgpt-4o-latest and Llama-3.1-405B climbs to #3.
