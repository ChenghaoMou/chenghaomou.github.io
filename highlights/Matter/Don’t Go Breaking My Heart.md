## Highlights
<mark>Few people understand how they work; many people anthropomorphizing those chatbots, attributing to them real intelligence and emotion. Kevin Roose writes about AI for a living and was genuinely concerned about what Sydney was saying. Naive users may take these bots even more seriously. * Larger language models seems more and more human-like (but the emotions that they present are no more real). Whatever we see now is likely to escalate. * Some people are building real attachments to those bots * In some cases, those who are building bots that actively cultivate those attachments, e.g., by feigning romantic and/or sexual interest or by dotting their messages with “friendly” emoticons. * Changes in those bots could leave many people in a vulnerable place. * There is essentially zero regulation on what these chatbots can say or do or how they can change over time, or on how they might treat their users. * Taking on a user in a chatbot like Replika is a long term commitment. But no known technology can reliably align a chatbot in a persistent way to a human’s emotional needs.</mark>

<mark>To my knowledge, tech companies are free to leverage a human gullibility around chatbot technologies however they like, without consequence, just as big teach companies previously leveraged to a human need for attention to the point of creating addictions to social media, even to the point of sometimes causing “Twitter poisoning”; with the new generation of chatbots, we will see addictions no less potent.</mark>
