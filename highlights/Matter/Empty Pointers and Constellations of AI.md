## Highlights
<mark>All computing is to some degree artificially intelligent. At one point a TI-83 calculator was artificial intelligence. When Google search first came out it was artificial intelligence. Frankly, a modern refrigerator counts as artificial intelligence: it's programmed to achieve an objective by taking action and uses environmental feedback to adjust its behaviour. These things are now so banal and pervasive we are unimpressed by their “intelligence.”</mark>

<mark>We use it to gesture at a future we cannot fully comprehend or currently realise. As soon as we do, it will no longer be “AI.”</mark>
