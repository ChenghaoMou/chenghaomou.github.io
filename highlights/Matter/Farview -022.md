## Highlights

> Sadly, I rarely get into the doing part. I convince myself that I need "more" content to feel confident and make a move. But more content introduces me to even more content, which leads to even more content... It's a never-ending cycle.

> We are entering the post-information era. A phase where we have easy access to the world's information, but not enough time to process the information. With each new AI tool invented that should supposedly help me with everything, I feel more drawn to taking notes. The old and boring way of writing by hand might be slower and less efficient than some AI bot summarizing everything I touch, but it surely helps me understand the information I interact with a lot better. What about you?
