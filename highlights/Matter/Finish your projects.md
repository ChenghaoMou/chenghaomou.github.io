## Highlights
> Maybe it was a great success, maybe it wasn't. That part is out of your control. Whatâ€™s in your control is seeing it all the way through, and you did that. Sometimes finishing is the end: You release the article, the podcast, the book, and that's it. The artifact is in its final form.

> For every vocal critic, there are 10 times as many people quietly following along and admiring not only your work, but your bravery to put it out publicly. Let that be an encouragement.
