## Highlights
<mark>But we can get some clarity by asking what OpenAI is trying to measure using these exams. If the goal is to predict how the language model will do on real-world tasks, there’s a problem. In a sense, any two bar exam questions or medical exam questions are more similar to each other than they are to the tasks that professionals do in the real world, because they are drawn from such a constrained space. So it’s possible that the inclusion of any exam questions in the training corpus results in an inflated estimate of real-world usefulness.</mark>

<mark>In some real-world tasks, shallow reasoning may be sufficient, but not always. The world is constantly changing, so if a bot is asked to analyze the legal consequences of a new technology or a new judicial decision, it doesn’t have much to draw upon. In short, as Emily Bender points out, tests designed for humans lack construct validity when applied to bots.</mark>

<mark>Just one of the 270 jobs in the 1950 census has been eliminated by automation: elevator operator. Instead, we need studies that actually evaluate professionals using the help of AI tools to do their jobs. Two early studies are promising: one looks at GitHub copilot for coding and the other looks at ChatGPT for writing assistance.</mark>

<mark>At this stage, we need qualitative studies more than quantitative ones, because these tools are so new that we don’t even know the right quantitative questions to ask. For example, Scott Guthrie of Microsoft reports the eye-catching number that 40% of the code checked in by GitHub Copilot users is AI-generated and unmodified. But any programmer will tell you that especially in enterprise applications, a large percentage of code consists of templates and other mundane logic that we usually copy-paste. If this is the part that Copilot is automating, the productivity improvement would be negligible. To be clear, we’re not saying that Copilot is useless, just that metrics are meaningless without a qualitative understanding of how professionals use AI. Besides, the primary benefit of AI-assisted coding might not even be the productivity improvement.</mark>
