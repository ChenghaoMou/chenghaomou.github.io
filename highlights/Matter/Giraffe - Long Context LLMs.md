## Highlights
> However, we believe that documents on which perplexity are measured often permit for a good performance simply by producing reasonably coherent text distributions conditional on a small subset of the entire available context. We show in this paper that perplexity is less sensitive for distinguishing long context performance between models for this reason than the new tasks that we introduced that are focused more strongly on accuracy of model recall than general text coherence.
