## Highlights

> When consolidating or abstracting, always think about the use cases you're serving. Don't sacrifice flexibility for the sake of "cleaner" code. Make sure your abstractions allow for the full range of functionality that the original implementation provided.

> Here are some tips for successful refactoring: 1. Be incremental: Make small, manageable changes rather than sweeping rewrites. 2. Deeply understand code before doing significant refactors or new abstractions. 3. Match the existing code style: Consistency is key for maintainability. 4. Avoid too many new abstractions: Keep it simple unless complexity is truly warranted. 5. Avoid adding new libraries, especially of a very different programming style, without buy-in from the team. 6. Write tests before refactoring and update them as you go. This ensures you're maintaining the original functionality. 7. Hold your coworkers accountable to these principles.
