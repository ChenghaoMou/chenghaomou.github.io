## Highlights
<mark>A prime example is in academia where achievement is measured by the number of published research papers. Because the number of papers is the target, professors find ways to publish lots (and we mean lots) of papers, most of which are of little or no value. The unintended consequence is that instead of doing worthwhile, but time-consuming, research that might result in a small number of important papers, researchers waste their time writing a large number of inconsequential papers.</mark>

<mark>The h-index (named after its creator Jorge E. Hirsch) is equal to the number of articles (h) that have been cited at least h times and is widely used for hiring, promotion, and funding decisions. The h-indexes are relatively small for many scientific giants who published a small number of extraordinary books and papers. The h-indexes are 97 for Charles Darwin, 70 for Niels Bohr, and 59 for Richard Feynman. Thousands of lesser scientists today (5,882 by a recent count) have an h-index of at least 100 and their ranks are increasing rapidly.</mark>

<mark>The fundamental problem that diverts university research and stifles innovation is Goodhart’s law. When scientific innovation is measured by publication counts, we will get more publications and less innovation.</mark>
