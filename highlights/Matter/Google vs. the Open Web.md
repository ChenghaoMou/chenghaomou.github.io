## Highlights
> The two problems with this line of thinking are that first, good regulatory frameworks are rare. And part of the reason for that is the second problem, namely that technology moves faster than the law. Which means that worrying about access instead of technology will still exclude marginalized groups in practice. What is required instead is to worry about technology in the short term, and regulation in the long term.
