## Highlights
<mark>Pichai and Dean reportedly responded by saying that Google’s AI language models are just as capable as OpenAI’s, but that the company had to move “more conservatively than a small startup” because of the “reputational risk” posed by the technology.</mark>

<mark>OpenAI, too, was previously relatively cautious in developing its LLM technology, but changed tact with the launch of ChatGPT, throwing access wide open to the public. The result has been a storm of beneficial publicity and hype for OpenAI, even as the company eats huge costs keeping the system free-to-use.</mark>

<mark>They amplify social biases found in their training data, often denigrating women and people of color; they are easy to trick (users found they could circumvent ChatGPT’s safety guidelines, which are supposed to stop it from providing dangerous information, by asking it to simply imagine it’s a bad AI); and — perhaps most pertinent for Google — they regularly offer false and misleading information in response to queries. Users have found that ChatGPT “lies” about a wide range of issues, from making up historical and biographical data, to justifying false and dangerous claims like telling users that adding crushed porcelain to breast milk “can support the infant digestive system.”</mark>

<mark>AI researchers Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell were fired from Google after publishing a paper outlining the technical and ethical challenges associated with LLMs (the same challenges that Pichai and Dean are now explaining to staff). And in May last year, a quartet of Google researchers explored the same question of AI in search, and detailed numerous potential problems. As the researchers noted in their paper, one of the biggest issues is that LLMs “do not have a true understanding of the world, they are prone to hallucinating, and crucially they are incapable of justifying their utterances by referring to supporting documents in the corpus they were trained over.”</mark>

<mark>As CEO Sam Altman recently tweeted: “ChatGPT is incredibly limited, but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness. it’s a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. it’s a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.”</mark>
