## Highlights

> "The idea is that cognition doesn't end at the brain and the person doesn't end at the the skin. Rather, cognition is extended. Personhood is messy, ambiguous, intertwined with the existence of others, and so on," she said. Tone of voice, gesture, eye contact, emotional context, facial expressions, touch, location, and setting are among the factors that influence what is said or written. Language behavior "cannot, in its entirety, be captured in representations appropriate for automation and computational processing. Written language constitutes only part of human linguistic activity," the paper says.
> Birhane argues that there are risks in releasing these models into the wild that would be unacceptable in other industries. "When we build bridges, for example, we do rigorous testing before we allow any vehicles or pedestrians to use it," she said. "Many other industries – pharma, for example – have proper regulations in place and we have established bodies that do the auditing and the evaluation. My biggest concern at the moment is that we're just building LLMs and releasing them into super important domains such as education and medicine. This has huge impacts, and also massive downstream impacts, say in 20 years, and where we're not doing proper testing, proper evaluations of these models."
