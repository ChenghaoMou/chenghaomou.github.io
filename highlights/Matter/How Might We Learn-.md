## Highlights

> Central to this is the idea of a daily ritual, a vessel for practice. Like meditation and exercise, I spend about ten minutes a day using my memory system. Because these exponential schedules are very efficient, those ten minutes are enough to maintain my memory for thousands of questions, and to allow me to add up to about forty new questions each day.

> One is pattern matching: once a question comes up a few times, I may recognize the text of the question without really thinking about it. This creates the unpleasant feeling of parroting, but I suspect it often leaves my memory brittle: I’ll remember the answer, but only when cued exactly as I’ve practiced. I wish the questions had more variability.

> Likewise, the questions are necessarily somewhat abstract. When I face a real problem in that domain, I won’t always recognize what knowledge I should use, or how to adapt it to the situation. A cognitive scientist would say I need to acquire schemas.
