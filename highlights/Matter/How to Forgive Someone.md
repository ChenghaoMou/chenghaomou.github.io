## Highlights
> But more than that, you need to come to terms with the fact that you will need to continue to forgive. Probably not dozens of times per day, like in the healthy eating example. But very likely it’s a process that never actually ends. That can be tough for a lot of people to hear, but it’s essential to come to terms with.

> Forgiveness is a commitment to managing your attention well whenever you’re reminded of an injury against you. Luckily, like many commitments, the more you practice, the easier it gets. Not that it ever gets easy necessarily—although often it actually does—but it doesn’t have to remain as hard as it is now.

> I’ve found that people who are able to successfully forgive things in the past have a fundamentally future-focused orientation to life. There’s a strong sense of agency and forward momentum in the way they go through life. It’s as if putting time and energy into the future makes it easier to let go of the past. On the other hand, people who struggle to forgive often spend a lot of their time and energy in the past and their futures are poorly defined and kind of empty.

> It’s hard to let go of the past when you don’t have much to look forward to in the future.
