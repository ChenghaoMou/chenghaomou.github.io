## Highlights

> People often assume that confidence is the absence of fear or anxiety, but in reality confidence is the belief that you can do something important despite your fear and anxiety.

> But when you avoid your emotions, you teach your brain to see them as threats and dangerous, which only makes them harder to handle. Not only does this increase your overall level of emotionality in the moment, it also lowers your emotional confidence—your belief in your ability to manage difficult emotions well. So, instead of avoiding your anxieties and insecurities in situations like this, practice validating them instead. When you’re feeling embarrassed, for example, after having an unfair criticism level against you, remind yourself that just because an emotion like embarrassment feels bad that doesn’t mean it is bad—or that you’re bad for feeling it.

> Try to practice the following psychological maneuver the next time you feel criticized: Instead of identifying with the criticism, abstract your self from the equation by clarifying what specifically they’re criticizing. For example: They said the analysis was terrible, not that I’m terrible. Or, Yes, she clearly didn’t think much of my suggestion, but that doesn’t mean anything about my worth as a person—or even what she thinks of me as a whole.

> By thanking your critic for their criticism, you reframe the criticism as feedback and an opportunity for growth, which tends to alleviate some of the anxiety. But more importantly, because you approached and were willing to have the fear and anxiety that comes with the criticism, you’re teaching your brain that it’s okay to be criticized and feel bad, and as a result, your confidence will rise.

> Here are four strategies for staying confident in the face of criticism: 1. Remind yourself that confidence is a belief, not a feeling. 2. Acknowledge and validate your emotional response to criticism. 3. De-identify with the criticism. 4. Thank them for their criticism.
