## Highlights
> There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability, practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to do the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability and to have practiced a lot and to be trying very hard. [1]

> And since you can't really change how much natural talent you have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reduces to working very hard.
