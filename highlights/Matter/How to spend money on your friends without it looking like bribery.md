## Highlights
<mark>When you own, you never “give” the wealth to your friends; you keep the asset to yourself—you’re just letting them access your assets temporarily, and your assets are returned to you at the end of the day. Hence it is actually more generous to just buy things for your friends, instead of buying things for yourself and letting your friends use them. Money can’t buy you happiness, but it can buy you socially acceptable excuses to do awesome activities with friends, and your friends bring you happiness.</mark>
