## Highlights

> 1) Try to explain the concept as best as you can (ideally out loud, as this is much more effective). Pretend youâ€™re having an imaginary conversation where you are explaining the concept to someone else. 2) While explaining the concept, focus on making it easier for them to understand. 3) Repeat this over and over, iteratively refining your explanation of the concept to give increasingly compressed and effective explanations. (Ideally continue until you can explain it from first principles only)
