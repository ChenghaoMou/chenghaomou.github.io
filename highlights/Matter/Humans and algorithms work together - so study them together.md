## Highlights
> Ironically, the persistence of algorithmic harms is the best reason to hope that they can be understood. A 2022 study of six of the most popular search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex and DuckDuckGo) found that in searches for images of migrant population groups, all six tended to amplify prejudiced and dehumanizing material16. One reason algorithms are curiously predictable is that their creators are so similar. Algorithm makers operate in similar legal environments, face similar economic conditions, receive similar training and use similar data sets17. The recurrence of algorithmic harms across many systems and situations could make them classifiable and preventable.
