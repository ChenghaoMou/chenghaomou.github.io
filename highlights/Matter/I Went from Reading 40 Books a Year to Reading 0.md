## Highlights

> My enthusiasm for books faded with the following realization: I wasn’t trying to improve like I said I was doing. I was trying to avoid improvement.

> When I was committing to 40 books per year, or 20 books per year, or whatever random number you can imagine, I was committing to something else as well. Subconsciously, as strange as it might sound, I was making a vow to not take action on what I learned from the book.

> After a book is finished, you’re left with mere breadcrumbs of the ideas discussed in the title. Sure, you might pick one or two theories and try to implement them in your life, but that’s not what usually happens.

> We enthusiastically update our profile with yet another finished book, but we have little idea of how to apply the gathered knowledge in real life.

> For many people, the act of reading is an elegant way to avoid doing something worthy with their lives.

> If we do some basic math, we’ll find that 40 books per year means around 3 books per month. This means that I have around 10 days to finish a book. Since I’m not a fast reader, nor do I plan to become one, this will mean that as soon as I finish one book, I have to start the next one. This approach to book reading suggests the following premise: that the act of finishing a book should also be the act of fully understanding the contents of the book.
