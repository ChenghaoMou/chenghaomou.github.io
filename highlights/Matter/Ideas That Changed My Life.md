## Highlights
> Sustainable sources of competitive advantage. This might be the most important topic in business and investing because other than luck it is the only path to long-term success. The only truly sustainable sources of competitive advantage I know of are: * Learn faster than your competition. * Empathize with customers more than your competition. * Communicate more effectively than your competition. * Be willing to fail more than your competition. * Wait longer than your competition.
