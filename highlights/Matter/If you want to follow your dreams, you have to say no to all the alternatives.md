## Highlights
<mark>Our desires are countless, independent agents, working to nudge our beachball in their own selfish direction. And so usually, that ball is going nowhere. It’s controlled more by the terrain than by the will of what’s inside it.</mark>

<mark>The more directions you’re being pulled in, the less distance you’ll travel.</mark>

<mark>Monomaniacal focus on a single goal is perhaps the ultimate success stratagem. It’s a pattern found in everyone from Edison to Einstein. When you’re able to focus on a single goal, constantly, your achievements reach their theoretical limit:</mark>

<mark>Put it off. Anything which isn’t top priority now can be done optimally later. Mark Zuckerberg was smart to start Facebook first and then learn Chinese. Your goals are the same, you’re just usually too attached to them in the moment to notice.</mark>

<mark>Beware your idle wants. Watch out for ‘other things that you also want’. They will feel comforting, harmless, and automatic. They are deadly. One new direction will quarter what you can accomplish.</mark>
