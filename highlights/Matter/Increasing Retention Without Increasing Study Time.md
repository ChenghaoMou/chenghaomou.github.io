## Highlights

> Our results suggest that a single session devoted to the study of some material should continue long enough to ensure that mastery is achieved but that immediate further study of the same material is an inefficient use of time.

> Our experiments demonstrate that powerful spacing effects occur over practically meaningful time periods. Furthermore, final test performance depends heavily on the duration of the spacing gap, with too-brief gaps causing poorer performance than excessively long gaps. Moreover, spacing effects generally seem to get bigger, not smaller, when one examines longer-term retention.

> In the realm of life-long learning, immersion-style foreign language courses are popular, yet their brevity, which prevents sufficient spacing, should produce deceptively high initial levels of learning, followed by rapid forgetting.
