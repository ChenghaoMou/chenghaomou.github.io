## Highlights
<mark>Our investigation shows the current state of the non-consensual AI porn supply chain: specific Reddit communities that are being scraped for images, the platforms that monetize these AI models and images, and the open source technology that makes it possible to easily generate non-consensual sexual images of celebrities, influencers, YouTubers, and athletes.</mark>

<mark>“In general, the policies sound difficult to enforce,” Tiffany Li, a law professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and an expert on privacy, artificial intelligence, and technology platform governance, told 404 Media. “It appears the company is trying, and there are references to concepts like consent, but it's all a bit murky.”</mark>
