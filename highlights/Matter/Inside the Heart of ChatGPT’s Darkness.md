## Highlights
<mark>It’s pure unadulterated anthropomorphism to think that ChatGPT has any moral views at all. From a technical standpoint, the thing that allegedly made ChatGPT so much better than Galactica, which was released a couple weeks earlier, only to be withdrawn three days later, was the guardrails. Whereas Galactica would spew garbage recklessly, and with almost no effort on the part of the user (like the alleged benefits of antisemitism), ChatGPT has guardrails, and those guardrails, most of the time, keep ChatGPT from erupting the way Galactica did.</mark>

<mark>The possibilities are now endless for propaganda, troll farms, and rings of fake websites that degrade trust across the internet. It’s a disaster in the making.</mark>
