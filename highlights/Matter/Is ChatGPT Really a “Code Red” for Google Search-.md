## Highlights
<mark>Rather, it’s the guardrails that OpenAI added with ChatGPT screens out many of the most offensive responses that LLMs might otherwise produce. The trouble is, those guardrails don’t come for free; the system is still shallow; ChatGPT doesn’t really know what it is it is guarding against; it mostly seems instead to be just looking for keywords, which is why it is prone to generating nonsense like this:</mark>

<mark>I like to call this sort of nonsense discomprehension: mindless answers that show that the systems has no clue what it is that is talking about.</mark>

<mark>Sorry, no such luck. As Michael Ma, Founder of ResearchRabbit.ai put it to me in an DM, with Google, you can follow things up, whereas with pure chat “the output is limited to lines of text – and your discovery journey ends”.</mark>

<mark>It is insidious the way that truth and falsity are so thoroughly and authoritatively mixed together. I for one am not ready for our post-truth information overlords.</mark>

<mark>(Traditional) search engines are databases, organized collections of data that can be stored, updated, and retrieved at will. (Traditional) search engines are indexes. a form of database, that connect things like keywords to URLs; they can be swiftly updated, incrementally, bit by bit (as when you update a phone number in the database that holds your contacts).</mark>

<mark>About the best thing I can say is that Perplexity.ai and you.com’s chat are genuinely exploring an interesting idea: hybrids that combine classical search engines with large language models, possibly allowing for swifter updates. But there’s still a ton of work left to do, in properly integrating the two, classical search and large language models. We have proof of concept, and some interesting research directions, but nothing like systems we can count on. (There are also economic issues and speed issues. The average Google search is nearly instantaneous and surely costs Google less than a penny, whereas answers to ChatGPT queries can take several seconds to compile, and some have estimated that ChatGPT queries cost a few cents each; it’s also less clear how to place to place ads..)</mark>
