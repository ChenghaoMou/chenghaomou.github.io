title: Is it time to hit the pause button on AI?

## Highlights
> But there is a third option, somewhere between these two poles, where government might allow for controlled AI research with a pause on large-scale AI deployment (e.g., open-ended chatbots rapidly rolled out to hundreds of millions of customers) until an effective framework that ensures AI safety is developed. There is plenty of precedent for this type of approach. New pharmaceuticals, for example, begin with small clinical trials and move to larger trials with greater numbers of people, but only once sufficient evidence has been produced for government regulators to believe they are safe. Publicly funded research that impacts humans is already required to be vetted through some type of research ethics board.Given that the new breed of AI systems have demonstrated the ability to manipulate humans, tech companies could be subjected to similar oversight.

> At present, anybody can release AI at whatever scale they like, with virtually no oversight, literally overnight. As was the case in the release of thalidomide, a porous and loose oversight system can allow products with no business being released to the public for use that causes harm. Events of recent weeks certainly suggest that the big titans of tech have shown they do not yet have the AI situation under control.

> The Goldilocks choice here is obvious. It’s time for government to consider frameworks that allow for AI research under a set of rules that provide ethical standards and safety, while pausing the widespread public dissemination of potentially risky new AI technologies—with severe penalties for misuse - until we can be assured of the safety of new technologies that the world frankly doesn't yet fully understand.
