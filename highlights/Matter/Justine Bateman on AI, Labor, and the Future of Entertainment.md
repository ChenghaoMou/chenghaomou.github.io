## Highlights
<mark>Because not only would you be replacing our work, but you’d be replacing our future work with an amalgamation of our past work.</mark>

<mark>But if you are, then all those people you’ve just mentioned, when you hire people in the entertainment business, if they’re part of a union, you not only have to pay for their work that day, but you also have to pay fringes, which is their pension and health. You have to feed them, you have to put them up if you’re on location, there are all these other expenses that are beyond just that salary. And if you could cut that out, then your profit margin would be incredible. And I think that’s the motivation in all the sectors that are adopting some form of generative AI, whether it’s just text or speech or full-blown video.</mark>

<mark>They didn’t even say, “Why would we talk about AI? We don’t know if that’s going to be useful at all.” When they said to the Writers Guild, we are not talking about it, I immediately knew that they had already fed in whatever scripts they could get ahold of into some kind of LLM.</mark>

<mark>It’s something I am 100% disinterested in. So for me as a filmmaker, I’m going in the complete opposite direction. I want to make new things that have a deeper emotional impact to the viewer than any work I’ve done before. Or ideally, what if I could make something that had a greater emotional impact than any film before? I don’t even know if that’s possible, but if you have that as a goal, you can’t use AI for anything. It’s generative, automatic imitation. So all it is going to regurgitate the past. I would never be making anything new, and I would also be stealing from myself of my own enjoyment to do anything, to make film.</mark> ^4c2e66

<mark>I love writing and directing. Why would I give that away to somebody? So for me, it’s not for me, but the job of these unions is to set a floor, set a default, and the default for actors and writers and directors too. I’d like to see directors’ past work protected because now they can feed it all in and just say, “Well, I want something that’s in the style of PT Anderson, or “I want something that’s in the style of Alfred Hitchcock or something like that.” Which I think we have a responsibility to not necessarily older, but to directors’ past work. We have a responsibility to all of those directors.</mark>

<mark>Because I had a Bloomberg journalist make a good point. She said, “It’s great in a way that it’s coming after the entertainment business first because you guys have really strong unions and people are also interested in your business. And so people are watching, people are listening.” And maybe we can become a template for, or at least a model for how to push back and not just lay down.</mark>

<mark>Yeah, I know there’s nothing I do about it, but fentanyl’s out there too. But I’m not going to go snort it because it’s available and it’s not the future. It’s an absolute 100% regression. It is the opposite of the future. It is the opposite of innovation, it is the opposite of the new. All it is regurgitating everything that is available online or otherwise. You could feed it in anything. I think it’s the absolute wrong direction for society and in particular the arts.</mark>
