## Highlights

> Questions from employees working on the project about legal issues were often dismissed by project managers, who said the decision to scrape videos without permission was an “executive decision” that they need not worry about, and the topic of what constitutes fair, ethical use of copyrighted content and academic, noncommercial-use datasets were regarded as an “open legal issue” that they’d resolve in the future.

> Our investigation highlights the ‘don't ask for permission’ ethos technology companies have when it comes to scraping massive amounts of copyrighted content into datasets for training some of the most valuable AI models in the world.

> Bender told 404 Media that companies are taking advantage of the legal gray area in which copyrighted content used in training data currently exists. “It seems to me there's definitely a culture of, ‘well, if we can grab it we can use it,’” she said. “This is very much predicated on what people want to be true, rather than predicated on either careful work, looking at the legalities of it, or deep thought about how it impacts people.”
