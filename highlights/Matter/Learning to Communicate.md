title: Learning to Communicate

## Highlights
> When we attempt to communicate an argument (or other message), we learn from our attempts to explain it clearly. After the initial draft, we revise—tightening our arguments, making our point of view clearer and more persuasive, adding additional supporting evidence, and anticipating possible objections. We learn from all of this. We wouldn’t if we asked an LLM to generate an essay for us.

> When I tell you what I think, you learn more about me. When you respond, I learn more about you. We learn about our similarities and differences and, if done politely, become closer. All of that is lost if our written communication becomes my LLM chatting with your LLM.
