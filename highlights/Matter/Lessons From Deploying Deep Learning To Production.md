## Highlights
> Around 90% of the problems were solved with careful data curation of difficult or rare scenarios instead of deep model architecture changes or hyperparameter tuning.

> One of the best predictors of success is the ability to effectively iterate on your model pipeline. That doesn't just mean iterating quickly, but also iterating intelligently. The
