## Highlights

> Some of that is because my career is 35 years long. But even some of the software I worked on five or ten years ago isn’t running anymore. This is another good reason to build small increments, just good enough, get them out there, and iterate from there. Anything more and you’ve overbuilt some software that isn’t going to run forever anyway.
