## Highlights
> He notes that in the 1960s, a pioneer chatbot called ELIZA convinced many psychiatric patients that they were interacting with a real psychiatrist. The machine simply repeated back their statements as questions, a popular psychiatric technique at the time because it generated more and more discussion — from the patient. The patients’ belief that they were interacting with a human being came to be called the Eliza effect.

> The root cause of the error is that GPT-3 only identifies likely sequences of words; it neither calculates nor responds to the logic of what is being asked. So, if there is no human who intervenes at the chatbot’s end, these nonsensical dialogues are comparatively easy to create.
