## Highlights
> There is no shortage of suggestions. Are accurate mathematical calculations enough, allowing us to call a pocket calculator intelligent? Is an accurate recitation of facts enough? Is logical reasoning the foundation of intelligence? Some say that good benchmarks are the ability to tell jokes and to recognize sarcasm, irony, connotation, and euphemisms. Another appealing yardstick is the ability to plan ahead; for example, bringing tools to help accomplish a task. Some say that human intelligence is biological and can never be achieved by non-biological entities, while others complain about moving goalposts.

> There are clearly many different kinds of intelligence and I think it is a distraction to argue about how computer intelligence might be assessed and quantified—a distraction that traces back to the unfortunate birthing of the label artificial intelligence at the 1956 Dartmouth summer conference that proposed that “every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” My fear is that people will be so bedazzled by articulate LLMs that they trust computers to make decisions that have important consequences.
