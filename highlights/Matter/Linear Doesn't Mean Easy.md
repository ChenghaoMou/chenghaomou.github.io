## Highlights

> The fun part of neural networks is the promise that no one has to understand linear algebra. You just have to be able to call an automatic differentiator and tweak some existing model, and you get a conference paper or push a feature to production. Automatic differentiation tools exist so you never have to compute derivatives anymore. Maybe you don’t need to think about eigenvalues and determinants and such. Maybe you can just pytorch pipette your way to papers. That’s possible. But if we choose this path, what do we lose?
