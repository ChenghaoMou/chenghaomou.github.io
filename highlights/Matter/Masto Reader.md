## Highlights

> LLMs are superficially good at many of these, but under stress (slight reformulations / manipulations away from corpus mean) break down in ways that are much more compatible with saying that what's going on is a reflection of what's in the data, and not the actual process that generated the data. They are terrible at the processes with which we repair broken norms (clarification requests, corrections, discussions, etc.).
