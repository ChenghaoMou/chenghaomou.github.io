## Highlights
<mark>Defining an MVP helps me stay focused, and it also ensures that I have a goal simple enough that I can be sure I’ll stay motivated long enough to get there.</mark>

<mark>When you minimize the number of moving parts, when you minimize complexity, you minimize the chances that your product, and your project, will fail.</mark>

<mark>The problem is that not all external dependencies are created equal.</mark>

<mark>Every library that you import is a piece of software you don’t have control over.</mark>

<mark>When I write software, I try to minimize the number of dependencies I rely on. I do this both to minimize possible points of failure, and to make sure that people installing my software won’t have a terrible time getting it to work.</mark>

<mark>Sometimes, I will “reinvent the wheel”, when I judge that the effort required is small enough. Obviously,</mark>

<mark>I prefer to build software that does one thing and does it well.</mark>
