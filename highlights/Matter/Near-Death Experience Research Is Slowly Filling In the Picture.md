## Highlights
<mark>Nicholson survived to tell the story, of course, and — looking back — she reflects, “Having a near-death experience caused me to have a sense of urgency to get things done, not knowing if my next minute alive would be my last. It also allowed me to live my life to the fullest, not worrying about other people’s opinions or the fear of ‘failure.’” Near-death experiences are commonly life-changing events that provide evidence that the human mind is not simply a function of the body and appears, at times, to operate independently of it.</mark>
