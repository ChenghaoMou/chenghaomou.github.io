title: Nine Tools I Wish I Mastered Before My PhD in Machine Learning

## Highlights
> Dropping bad habits can be difficult. With every tool outlined below I had to accept that the way I did things was suboptimal. However, in the process I have also learnt that at times results not seen in the moment pay off ten fold at a later stage.

> Screen lets you launch and use multiple shell sessions from a single ssh session. The process started with screen can be detached from session and then reattached at a later time. So your experiments can be run in the background, without the need to worry about session closing, or terminal crashing.

*screen vs tmux*
