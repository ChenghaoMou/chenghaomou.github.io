## Highlights
<mark>Without a sense of what it is in the training corpus, it’s almost impossible to conclude anything about what a machine truly understands and how general that is. You never know when the answer might more or less already be in the undisclosed training set. Beating a bunch of untrained humans on a bunch of tasks where the machine had a large amount of memorized data might not really tell us much.</mark>

<mark>It’s a huge downgrade in our goals for artificial general intelligence to say “better than the average untrained human on many tasks”; the point is that we should expect machines to do what we ask them to do; when I press the square root button on my calculator, I expect an accurate approximation to that square root; when I press the accelerator on my car, I expect the car to go forward. If I ask a chatbot to write a biography, I expect it to summarize knowledge, not to make stuff up. An artificial general intelligence should do the things that it is asked to do, and decline to do those that it can’t, and have the wisdom to know the difference. Dropping from “as smart as the Star Trek computer” to better than Joe Sixpack should not be our goal.</mark>
