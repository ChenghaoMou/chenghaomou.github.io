## Highlights
<mark>A theory of human language should help us to understand why human languages have the particular character that they do, and why for example, they differ from the kinds of artificial languages we find in computer programming and mathematics.</mark>

<mark>As it happens, systems like GPT-3 provide remarkably little in the way of explanation. They don’t tell us why the world is as it is; they merely mimic statistical patterns of how language has been used in their immense databases.</mark>

<mark>In GPT-3’s case the mechanism of the prediction is essentially regurgitation; such systems are trained on literally billions of words of digital text; their gift is in finding patterns that match what they have been trained on. This is a superlative feat of statistics, but not one that means, for example, that the system knows what the words that it uses as predictive tools mean. It would not prove that a parrot knew anything about the sky, if a parrot could complete the sentence “The sky is __”.</mark>

<mark>GPT-3 is a model of how words relate to one another, not a model of how language might relate to the perceived world.</mark>

<mark>Chomsky spent a large part of his career trying to get people to think about why human language is the way that it is. The why question, is to be sure, incredibly difficult, in part because no other extant species has anything remotely like it, and in part because we don’t (and shouldn’t) do invasive studies in which we carve open living human brains or (e.g.) teach humans artificial languages in lieu of natural languages in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms.</mark>
