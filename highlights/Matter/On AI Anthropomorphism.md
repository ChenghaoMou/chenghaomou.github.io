## Highlights
<mark>By elevating machines to human capabilities, we diminish the specialness of people. I’m eager to preserve the distinction and clarify responsibility. So I do not think machines should use first-person pronouns, but should describe who is responsible for the system or simply respond in a machine-like way. Sometimes it takes a little imagination to get the right phrasing, but it is best when it is more compact.</mark>

<mark>The issue is NOT if humans can relate to a deceptive social machine — of course they can. The issue is “Do we recognize that humans and machines are different categories?” or “Will we respect human dignity, by designing effective machines that enhance human self efficacy and responsibility?” The 2M+ apps in the Apple Store are mostly based on direct manipulation. Major applications like Amazon shopping, Google search, navigation, etc. avoid human-like designs because they have come to understand that they are suboptimal and unpopular. Can Michael point to 3 widely used apps that have a human-like interface?</mark>

<mark>The UIs that we have built do have social presence. We can design them so that they seem to have distinct personalities — even though we know that smart toasters don’t have personalities. Parrots have something like personalities, but not stochastic parrots (Bender et al., 2021). But stochastic parrots can have a kind of social presence. That makes them strange and new, because they mix attributes of toasters and of social beings. People have written about the “uncanny valley.” When I said “strange,” I could have said “uncanny.” I think they are usefully, productively strange. They</mark>

<mark>So you could say intelligence is a continuum, but responsibility is more binary and is an important factor in design. I think the discussion cannot be limited to intelligence, but must include memory, perceptual, cognitive, and motor abilities. I’m interested in stressing design which clarifies that AI tools are designed by humans and organizations, which are legally responsible for what they do and for what the tools do, although tools can be misused, etc.</mark>

<mark>While Reeves & Nass’ studies demonstrated that users would respond to computers socially, they did not consider the alternative hypothesis, which was that users would prefer the direct manipulation interfaces that have remained dominant in the Apple and Android Stores and web-based laptop designs. In conclusion, while there are situations in which computers can become commercial successes by pretending to be a person, the dominant design remains the mobile device touchscreen and the web-based mouse clicks that keep users in control and avoids the anthropomorphic design (I would say trap!). I think there is a clear alternative to anthropomorphism. The issue is bigger than pronouns.</mark>
