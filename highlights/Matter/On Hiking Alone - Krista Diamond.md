## Highlights
> Here is my official statement on why I do most things alone: I am a lone wolf. I am comfortable with myself. I like myself. I have a rich interior life. I am independent. I am selfish. I am faster, more efficient on my own. I like to make the eight-hour drive from Las Vegas to Reno all in one go, stopping to photograph an old brothel in Mina and eat a burger in Hawthorne, listening to the music I like, staying at the hotel I want to stay at, watching the TV show I want to watch when I get there.

> At a certain point, you start to realize it’s easier to not be around at all. And there’s pleasure in being alone.

> Each email another person, just as isolated as me. I imagined us all, in our separate apartments, in the dark with our computers, scrolling the internet in search of each other.

> That I’m a fraud. That I am not a lone wolf, but merely someone who can’t connect with people. That sometimes I am so lonely I can actually feel my heart physically hurting, like it’s made of something solid that is cracking. Like it’s made of water that is expanding, not because it is full but because it is freezing.
