## Highlights
<mark>Mission scientists orient themselves toward a shared normative stance. They pose research questions and gather data in service of that shared normative position. They aim to help. And so, naturally, they also engage with policymakers and advocates.</mark>

<mark>Like, you could do this study, but why should you? I generally find this sort of early self-interrogation can drastically improve the ultimate work product.</mark>

<mark>And this is all methodologically-sound social science! Some of it is really quite sophisticated. But it is a far cry from the mission science that I so admired in my youth. It often seems to be driven more by data availability than by any core normative commitment or pragmatic concern. The result is that I often felt as though my disciplinary colleagues were inordinately concerned with the precise measurement of utter trivialities. It is research that does not aim to help.</mark>
<mark>There is an ocean of distance between “nothing to hide” and “nothing that could be willfully misconstrued.” Again, it’s 2023. We all know very well by now how strategic actors can fabricate controversy that causes real personal harm. As a social scientist, I am livid that my field has been turned into a political football like this.</mark>

<mark>We’ve seen this playbook before. The tobacco industry spent years politicizing science in an effort to prevent governments and advocates from doing anything about the public health dangers posed by cigarette smoke. Fossil fuel companies have taken the same approach to climate scientists. Politicizing science and trying to sever the relationship between research and policy was in the companies’ strategic interest, even if it proved deadly for the public at large. The downside of mission science is that, once your scientific research proves relevant, it also can make you a target of smear campaigns.</mark>

<mark>These are good, honorable social scientists. Their lives are being made hellish, not because of any doubts about the merit of their scientific research, but because they have proven too relevant to the complicated work of governance. (No one gets a subpoena for counting congressional tweets, because no one in power notices that research to begin with.)</mark>
