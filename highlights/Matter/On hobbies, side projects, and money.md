## Highlights

> We need to accept that in order for the open, non hyper-commercial web to stay alive, we all have to do our part and we have to contribute something to it. Because running the sites you enjoy takes time and effort. And it costs money. We can’t expect everyone to do everything for free, forever. And we also can’t complain about the endless proliferation of ads and paywalls if we’re not willing to contribute even as little as 1$ ourselves.
