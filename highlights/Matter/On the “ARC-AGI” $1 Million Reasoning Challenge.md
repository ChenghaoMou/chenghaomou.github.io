## Highlights
> ARC now is a $500,000 target where everyone is aiming at the bullseye. The problem is that when people focus on a specific target (e.g., top score on the ARC private evaluation set), they sometimes lose site of what the benchmark is actually trying to measure (e.g., capacities for few-shot abstraction based on core knowledge concepts), and the methods developed to hit the target might miss the original motivation altogether.
