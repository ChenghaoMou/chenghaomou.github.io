## Highlights
<mark>and it’s not just that hallucinatory web search could be dangerous if left to run amok in domains like medicine, it’s that the promises themselves are problematic, when examined from a scientific perspective. Scaling neural network models—making them bigger—has made their faux writing more and more authoritative-sounding, but not more and more truthful. Hallucinations are in their silicon blood, a byproduct of the way they compress their inputs, losing track of factual relations in the process. I first pointed out this risk in 2001, in the fifth chapter of my book The Algebraic Mind, and the problem has persisted ever since. To blithely assume that the problem will soon go away is to ignore 20 years of history.</mark>
