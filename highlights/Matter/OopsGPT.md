## Highlights

> Herein lies one of the biggest problems with tech companies’ prophecies about an AI change: Chatbots are supposed to revolutionize first the internet and then the physical world. For now they can’t properly copy-paste from a music festival’s website.

> This is really the core dynamic of the AI boom: A tech company releases a dazzling product, and the public finds errors. The company claims to incorporate that feedback into the next dazzling product, which upon its release a few months later exhibits similar flaws. The cycle repeats. At some point, awe will need to give way to evidence.
