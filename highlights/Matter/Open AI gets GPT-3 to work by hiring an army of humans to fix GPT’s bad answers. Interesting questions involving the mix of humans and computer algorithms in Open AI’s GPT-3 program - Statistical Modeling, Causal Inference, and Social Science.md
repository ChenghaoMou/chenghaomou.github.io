## Highlights
<mark>GPT-3: Yes, there is nothing to worry about. It’s safe because the spiral stairs curve outwards, it will make your descent uncomfortable. As Smith writes, “Questions like this are simple for humans living in the real world but difficult for algorithms residing in MathWorld because they literally do not know what any of the words in the question mean.”</mark>

No commonsense at all.
<mark>but facts are not random.</mark>

Facts are not diverse either.
<mark>OpenAI evidently employs 40 humans to clean up GPT-3’s answers manually because GPT-3 does not know anything about the real world. Intrigued, I retried the questions that GPT-3 had flubbed in January to see if the labelers had done their job.</mark>

<mark>On the other hand, there does seem something funny about GPT-3 presents this shiny surface where you can send it any query and it gives you an answer, but under the hood there are a bunch of freelancers busily checking all the responses and rewriting them to make the computer look smart.</mark>
