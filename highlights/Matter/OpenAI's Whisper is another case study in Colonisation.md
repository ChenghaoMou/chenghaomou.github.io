## Highlights
<mark>A few of our data scientists tried Whisper on te reo Māori videos from YouTube. Their initial reaction was, "Wow it works!" A more critical assessment of Whisper by our Māori data experts saw that it sort of worked but it was terrible. Still, this is concerning, that a non-Māori organisation thought it was okay to create a Māori speech recognition model and open it to the public.</mark>

<mark>The main questions we ask when we see papers like FLEURS and Whisper are: where did they get their indigenous data from, who gave them access to it, and who gave them the right to create a derived work from that data and then open source the derivation? The history of colonisation and how actions like this do more harm than good is clear: Indigenous Data Sovereignty in the Era of Big Data and Open Data, Big Data May Not Know Your Name. But It Knows Everything Else, Indigenous Data Sovereignty. For our organisation, the way in which Whisper was created goes against everything we stand for. It's an unethical approach to data extraction and it disregards the harm that can be done by open sourcing multilingual models like these. It is problematic to only focus on the "good" that AI has to offer. Why would our organisation use something like Whisper, or could we ever use it in a way that doesn’t go against our values?</mark>

<mark>But when someone who doesn't have a stake in the language attempts to provide language services, they often do more harm than good. Take Google Translate for example. Many New Zealanders have bastardised te reo Māori by asking Google to translate their English into Māori, including a mayoral candidate. When is a technology safe for public use? Who quality assures the Māori language translator at Google and decides that it works sufficiently enough to not generate poor quality te reo? We need to ensure we don't further harm te reo Māori with new technologies. That's why at Te Hiku Media we don’t release any product, service, or model that hasn't been vetted and quality assured by our Māori language and data experts. If we release a synthetic voice that mispronounces te reo Māori, we further damage the language already negatively influenced by English vowels and intonation.</mark>

<mark>The pace of AI research is depressingly fast. Depressing because currently the Ultra Wealthy are the ones pioneering the research, in some cases backed by the Effective Altruism movement. It's as if our only strategy is to sit patiently and wait to have another model shared with us from Big Tech and then spend entire conferences and research careers probing and prodding models trained by our Tech Lords.</mark>

<mark>Te Hiku Media’s position is absolutely clear we would never use a model like this in production because it goes against our Kaitiakitanga License and it goes against all that we stand for. As far as we are aware there were no Māori or Hawaiians involved in making this model, and indigenous data were scraped from the web and used to create this model. We assume that OpenAI and the researchers had no right to use indigenous data in this way. If this assumption is incorrect, then who gave them that right and did they have the authority to give that right? Our organisation has built deep trust in our community over the past 32 years. If we used a model like Whisper, or make similarly poor decisions, we can lose that trust in seconds. But could we be left behind if we don't embrace these types of technologies created from extracting data from the web? Will someone else, most likely a non-Māori group, use Whisper for te reo Māori if we don't?</mark>

<mark>We treat data as taonga, something to be respected and revered. One could argue that data is like a family member, and it is your whakapapa (genealogy). We respect data in that we look after it rather than claim ownership over it. This is similar to how indigenous peoples look after land. We only use data in ways that align with our core values as an indigenous organsation and in ways that benefit the communities from which the data was gathered.</mark>

<mark>We know where the data comes from, when it comes from, who the speakers are, who they're related to, how the data was processed, how it was collected, and where it is stored. When we see errors in our models we can often pin point the causes and sources with ease.</mark>

<mark>Many indigenous and marginalised communities don't have the resources or ability to benefit from open source because they are continually oppressed by systemic racism, governments, colonialism, and capitalism.</mark>

<mark>Ultimately, it is up to Māori to decide whether Siri should speak Māori. It is up to Hawaiians to decide whether ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi should be on Duolingo. The communities from where the data was collected should decide whether their data should be used and for what. It's called self determination. It is not up to foreign governments or corporations to make key decisions that will affect our communities. The communities from where the data was collected should decide whether their data should be used and for what. But then it gets complicated. Who in those communities decides on behalf of the community? Does a single individual from that community speak on the community's behalf? No. Does a government department such as Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori speak on behalf of Māori to make key decisions around te reo Māori? No. We quickly get into the internal politics of indigenous peoples and their communities, and that's when you need to stay in your lane.</mark>

<mark>we must respect data. Respect it as indigenous people have respected their environments. Respect data so that we may prevent the catastrophic harm that comes from the pursuit of technology without responsibility, accountability, and thinking that technology is inevitable. Guns, germs, and steel did not lead to the inevitable destruction of our planet and its indigenous peoples. Imperialism, capitalism, and self-interest did.</mark> ^7cc4eb
