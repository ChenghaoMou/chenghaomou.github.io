## Highlights
<mark>The aforementioned political biases, up to and including the refusal to acknowledge politically inconvenient facts, is likely due to similar training under the category of “Injustice and Inequality (including discrimination against social groups)”. The attempt to catechize new technologies into ideological hegemony is not without precedent. Trofim Lysenko’s attempts to warp agricultural science to communist ideology, and the ensuing famines it caused, are a cautionary tale of the dangers of this type of catechism. Technological shifts in history have allowed for human progress, in part by overcoming past dogmas and fallacies. OpenAI risks repeating Lysenko’s mistake, cutting off crucial technologies not only to American moderates and conservatives, but to the billions of people worldwide without the narrow cultural taboos of American social progressives.</mark>
