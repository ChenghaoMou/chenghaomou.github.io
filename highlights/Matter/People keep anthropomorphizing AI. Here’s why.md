## Highlights
> Experts concerned about this trend have been trying to emphasize that large language models are merely trying to predict the next word in a sequence. LLMs have been called stochastic parrots, autocomplete on steroids, bullshit generators, pastiche generators, and blurry JPEGs of the web. On the other hand, there’s the media, which reaches way more people.

> These behaviors have no utility in the context of a search engine and could have been avoided through reinforcement learning, so it is irresponsible of Microsoft to have released the bot in this state. The stochastic parrots paper was prescient in recommending that human mimicry be a bright line not to be crossed until we understand its effects.

> Recognizing that anthropomorphization is beneficial but double edged, researchers have started to develop design guidelines. Similarly, we need research on interactions with chatbots to better understand their effects on people, come up with appropriate design guardrails, and give people better mental tools for interacting with them. Human-computer interaction researchers have long been thinking about these questions, but they’ve taken on new significance with chatbots.

> Here, anthropomorphizing is a useful way to predict that the effect of these technologies, without regulatory or other interventions, is likely to be labor-displacing rather than productivity-enhancing.

> Developers should avoid behaviors that make it easy to anthropomorphize these tools, except in specific cases such as companion chatbots. Journalists should avoid clickbait headlines and articles that exacerbate this problem. Research on human-chatbot interaction is urgently needed. Finally, experts need to come up with a more nuanced message than “don’t anthropomorphize AI”. Perhaps the term anthropomorphize is so broad and vague that it has lost its usefulness when it comes to generative AI.
