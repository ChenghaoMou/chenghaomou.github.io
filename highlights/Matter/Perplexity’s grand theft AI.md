title: Perplexity’s grand theft AI

## Highlights
> The value proposition on search, originally, was that by scraping the work done by journalists and others, Google’s results sent traffic to those sources. But by providing an answer, rather than pointing people to click through to a primary source, these so-called “answer engines” starve the primary source of ad revenue — keeping that revenue for themselves. Perplexity is among a group of vampires that include Arc Search and Google itself.

> Even if Perplexity itself isn’t violating the code, it is reliant on someone else violating the code for its “answer engine” to work.

> It’s a good-faith agreement that has held up for decades now, and it’s falling apart thanks to unscrupulous AI companies — that’s right, Perplexity isn’t the only one — hoovering up just about anything that’s available in order to train their bullshit models. And remember how Srinivas said he was committed to “factfulness?” I’m not sure that’s true, either: Perplexity is now surfacing AI-generated results and actual misinformation, Forbes reports.
