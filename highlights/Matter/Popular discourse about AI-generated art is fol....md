## Highlights
<mark>Can new technology "trick" viewers into believing it's the "real thing" is an exercise in futility. We are seeing this with AI-generated visual images, with Chat GPT, etc.</mark>

<mark>The question isn’t “which is by Manet & which is by a Robot?” The question is: “which is a digital reproduction of another repro of an object made by Manet; & which is a synthesis of digital repros of repros of works that people have labeled on the internet w the word Manet?”/15</mark>

<mark>The more valuable questions to ask are about the data on which AI-generated text & images are based & the asymmetries in power, money, & cultural value that make some data more plentiful online.</mark>
