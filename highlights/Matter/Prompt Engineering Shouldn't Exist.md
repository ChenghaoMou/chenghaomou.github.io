## Highlights
<mark>What happens when prompts get more complex? A series of conditional statements and control flow that output a prompt? What happens when base prompts are more than concatenation but are generated on a user-by-user basis? The templates will only continue to get more complex.</mark>

<mark>NLP is a functional interface, but it isn't the ultimate one. For example, it isn't a good fit for building infrastructure building blocks and isn't a good interface for stitching systems together. Prompt engineering looks more like a systems engineering problem, not a machine learning one. Of course, designing an LLM-friendly workflow engine becomes the hard part. How do you efficiently dispatch workloads and steps to other runtimes or back to LLMs? How do you use the output of actions in other steps? This a classic problem in CI/CD and orchestration. So prompt engineering as an NLP task will go away fairly quickly. Instead, we'll figure out ways to bring more structure to the input and output of querying LLMs.</mark>
