At some later time (relatively soon), go through these references and see if there's anything you have further thoughts on. 4. Consider whether these thoughts relate to other thoughts you've recorded in your zettelkasten. 5. When possible, create new notes based on your own interpretation of the captured ideas, in your own words, in conversation with the other notes already stored in your zettelkasten. 6.
