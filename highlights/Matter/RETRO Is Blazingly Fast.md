title: RETRO Is Blazingly Fast

## Highlights
> The MIPS index is the reason the RETRO database lookup is so fast. MIPS stands for maximum inner-product search, which is when you search a database of vectors for the ones closest to your “query” vector. In RETRO, we use this to look up chunks of text from The Pile that are similar to our input.
