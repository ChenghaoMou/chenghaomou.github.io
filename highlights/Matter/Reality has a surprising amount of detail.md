## Highlights

> The more difficult your mission, the more details there will be that are critical to understand for success.

> This problem is not easy to fix, but it's not impossible either. I've mostly fixed it for myself. The direction for improvement is clear: seek detail you would not normally notice about the world. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built. When you talk to someone who is smart but just seems so wrong, figure out what details seem important to them and why. In your work, notice how that meeting actually wouldn't have accomplished much if Sarah hadn't pointed out that one thing. As you learn, notice which details actually change how you think.
