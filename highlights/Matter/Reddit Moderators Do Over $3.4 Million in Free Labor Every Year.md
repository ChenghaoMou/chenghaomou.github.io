## Highlights
<mark>They often denigrate and misunderstand the cultural, social, and people-centered elements in their success. They run social networks, but don’t seem to understand the “social” part. Let’s quickly revisit that quote of Huffman’s from his interview with NPR … “Reddit represents one of the largest data sets of just human beings talking about interesting things,” Huffman said. Calling Reddit a “data set” composed of “human beings talking about interesting things” is so hilariously alienated that it’s practically Martian. It’s not an inaccurate description; but it’s a punch-card’s view of the affair. Reddit is a glorious riot of human interaction, alternately enlightening and enervating, joyous and maddening. I strongly doubt that any Redditor logs on with the excited thought of “wow, I can’t wait to add my voice to the data set.”</mark>
