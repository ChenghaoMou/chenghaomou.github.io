## Highlights
<mark>But the effectiveness of raising concerns hinges on the ability of people who raise them to be safe. So, if you don’t come out when me and Meg are being fired, if you don’t come out when others are being retaliated against, when research is being suppressed, then you are tacitly endorsing an environment that punishes people for raising concerns.</mark>

<mark>What I hear in that is, “Those aren’t existential to me. I have millions of dollars, I am invested in many, many AI startups, and none of this affects my existence. But what could affect my existence is if a sci-fi fantasy came to life and AI were actually super intelligent, and suddenly men like me would not be the most powerful entities in the world, and that would affect my business.”</mark>
