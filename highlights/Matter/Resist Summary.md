## Highlights
> I think avoiding summary is even more important when writing, possibly its the first step to good writing. You are a primary source. Lots of people couch their opinions with citations, or “studies show”, or they create writing that is an attempt to shorten some portion of thought or history. But this mostly makes for less interesting writing. I think one should write as much as they can with their own empiricism, their own senses, giving the reader their own characterization of life or events.

> The nature of the output, of summary, is speed things along. But the consequence is to avoid you having to build your own complex mental model of anything. I worry that without a complex model in one’s own mind, one may never notice complex relationships that are otherwise missed. A loss of attention to detail.
