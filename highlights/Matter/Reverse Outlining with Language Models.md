## Highlights
<mark>You start with a long, rambling, unorganised slew of text first: you write the messy and chaotic first draft without worrying too much about structure. Then you go through the piece and for every paragraph, write a single sentence that summarises it.</mark>

<mark>This process helps you do a few important things: * Easily spot logical flaws or holes in your argument * Add transitional bridges between paragraphs that make large leaps or change topics unexpectedly * Combine paragraphs that are trying to say the same thing * Remove paragraphs you don't need or are tangential to the argument * Break up paragraphs that are trying to say too many things in one breath * Arrange your points into a narrative arc that will make sense to the reader</mark>
