## Highlights

> I think many people are going to use it for automation because that's the why. That's what companies are being told. You know, if you talk to business leaders today, everybody's asking them — financial journalists, their shareholders, and their friends — “where are you with the AI investment?” So that's the hype. And then people are going to rush in to use AI, to implement AI, even when they don't know what to do with it. And automation will often appeal to them because it's like the easiest thing to do. It's the thing that they may experience from other technologies and it's the thing that some people are telling them that that's what they should do. There are companies, integrators, and websites devoted to automation [with] AI. Even though it doesn't really automate anything. Even though it wouldn't be very good at it. I mean, again, it could automate some tasks. You could have more of your customer service done without people. But even then, even then that feels like a stretch of what automation means because, using the customer service example — and I think you may have raised this point as well — how does it get better? How do you measure better in the case of customer service? But even then it's automation only in so much as you can trust it. And it feels like these core issues of hallucinations almost kill the concept of automation with generative.
