## Highlights

> There was a company-wide effort to compile videos into spreadsheets to serve as training, a former Runway employee told 404 Media. After the list of videos was compiled, Runway scraped the videos using open-source software, specifically YouTube-DL, which has a proxy configuration option. Runway purchased proxies from a provider, the source said, which gives customers an IP address that routes requests for downloads through, in order to not get blocked by YouTube.
