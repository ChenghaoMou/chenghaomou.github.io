title: Setting your ML project up for success

## Highlights
> Are you making sure to avoid biases from the get-go, as much as you can? How will data be collected, by whom, and what motive do users have to fill in certain fields? (don't get me started on diagnose codes in Real World Evidence data!) How can data be anonymized while still preserving relevant correlations? Which features will be important to inform the modeling later on? How will you evaluate "success" of the project at the end?

> That includes making sure that data collection and annotation is done with the necessary care and consideration. It's what drew me to Explosion to begin with: the seamless integration between the NLP toolkit spaCy and the scriptable annotation framework Prodigy ensures that you can iterate quickly on your data and your NLP algorithms/models.
