## Highlights
> Underlying the decision to move X10 out of the project once the system was operational, is the common misconception that software development consists of producing code; that, once working code exists, programmers should act as interchangeable operators of varying qualities.

> Programming should be regarded as an activity by which the programmers form or achieve a certain kind of insight, a theory, of the matters at hand. This suggestion is in contrast to what appears to be a more common notion, that programming should be regarded as a production of a program and certain other texts.

> So the next time you choose a name, or structure a project, or ponder whether to write or omit a certain comment, rather than thinking in terms of the burden on future maintainers, think: how much will this decision affect—how much will it help or hinder—their building of a mental model of the system, of the business, of the world.
