## Highlights
<mark>Hard languages for English speakers to learn would include Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean, which don’t have much in common with English. They can say the same things but quite differently. Easy languages, no surprise here, would be French, Spanish, Italian, etc., which have many features in common with English. Of course, it works the same in reverse. It’s much easier for a Cantonese speaker to learn Mandarin than to learn English.</mark>
