## Highlights
<mark>Staring into the abyss means thinking reasonably about things that are uncomfortable to contemplate, like arguments against your religious beliefs, or in favor of breaking up with your partner.</mark>

<mark>It’s common to procrastinate on thinking hard about these things because it might require you to acknowledge that you were very wrong about something in the past, and perhaps wasted a bunch of time based on that (e.g. dating the wrong person or praying to the wrong god).</mark>

<mark>This makes sense since both making effective life decisions and having novel insights require you to figure out non-obvious true things about the world, which are sometimes uncomfortable or scary, and therefore you’ll only figure them out if you’re good at staring into the abyss.</mark>

<mark>For example, it’s common for students at elite colleges to follow the mantra of “do what you love” and choose a major that doesn’t have very good job prospects, without really grappling with that fact until their final year. (I’m not saying that they don’t think about it at all, just that they don’t work effectively on solving that problem—which is completely understandable since they mostly have way too little life experience to do a good job at that, and don’t generally get much support from their environment.)</mark>

<mark>Thinking about whether to leave your job is uncomfortable in a few different ways: it involves acknowledging that you made a poor decision in the past (taking your current job) that wasted a bunch of time; it involves signing up for a bunch more difficult, stressful work to interview at new jobs; and it saps your motivation to invest in getting better at your current job if you think it’s likely that you’ll leave soon. So it’s understandable that people procrastinate on staring into that abyss. But that procrastination leads to a lot of avoidable suffering.</mark>

<mark>If you do it too little, you’ll end up taking too long to make important life improvements; but if you do it too often, you might end up not investing enough in being great at your current job or relationship because you’re too focused on the prospect of next one.</mark>

<mark>* If you had to leave your job today, what would you do instead? * What’s the best argument in favor of doing that right now? * If you have a partner, what’s the best argument in favor of breaking up with them? * Are there ways you behave that you wish you didn’t? What unacknowledged desires could be driving those? * What have you said “yes” to that you wouldn’t say “hell yes” to? (prompted by Alex Watt) * Is there something you “should” do that you’re not currently doing? Why? (prompted by Silas Strawn) * What bad things are you afraid of happening? Imagine in detail what it would be like if they happened. (prompted by Kamilé Lukosiute) * What do you need that you’re not currently getting? (—David MacIver) * What are you avoiding because it conflicts with some part of your identity / self-image? (—Nicholas Schiefer; more at link) * “What is the biggest thing in your life that you just kinda casually fell into and would you have made a conscious decision to do it if you’d known in advance everything you know now?” (—@GeniesLoki; hundreds more at link)</mark>
