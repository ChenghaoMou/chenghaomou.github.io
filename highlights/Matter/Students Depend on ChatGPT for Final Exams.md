title: "Students Depend on ChatGPT for Final Exams"
---

## Highlights
<mark>Students report using ChatGPT on final exams and papers according to a recent write-up from The College Fix. One College of Staten Island student used the bot on both final exams and “got As on both.” He commented that “half the kids in my class used it.” The student also noted that he used the chatbot to complete a multiple-choice exam, on which he got an almost perfect score.</mark>

<mark>The only way to become a better writer is to write. Ultimately, good writing reflects the soul of the writer…and Davinci doesn’t have one. Depending on AI won’t just deprive you of refining a critical skill in college – it will ensure that ‘your’ writing is soulless and forgettable.”</mark>

<mark>To think its feats are comparable to the human mind is to assume people are akin are computational machines, but true education should be concerned with something more profound than input and output. As Dorothy Sayers writes in The Lost Tools of Learning, “For the sole true end of education is simply this: to teach men how to learn for themselves; and whatever instruction fails to do this is effort spent in vain.”</mark>
