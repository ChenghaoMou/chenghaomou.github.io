title: "Talking about a ‘schism’ is ahistorical"
---

## Highlights
<mark>The problem with the ‘schism’ framing is that to talk about a ‘schism’ is to talk about something that once was a whole and now is broken apart — authors that use this metaphor thus imply that such a whole once existed. But this is emphatically not a story of a community that once shared concerns and now is broken into disagreeing camps. Rather, there are two separate threads — only one of which can properly be called a body of scholarship — that are being held up as in conversation or in competition with each other. I think this forced pairing comes in part from the media trying to fit the recent AI doomer PR pushes into a broader narrative and in part from the fact that there is competition for a limited resource: policymaker attention.</mark>

<mark>The unequal distributions of power (financial and otherwise) shapes what people can see, who gets listened to, and who is willing to cross what boundaries. What is in common across this group, however, is an engagement with actual harms to real people and our world.</mark>

<mark>For example, take the recent “Sparks of AGI” paper (non-peer-reviewed speculative fiction novella, uploaded to arXiv) from Microsoft research. The first version of this paper took its definition of ‘intelligence’ from a 1997 WSJ editorial written in support of Herrnstein & Murray’s 1994 The Bell Curve. It appears that none of the authors on “Sparks of AGI” had actually read to the second page of the WSJ editorial, where the overtly racist claims that Black and Latinx people are (on average) less ‘intelligent’ than white people can be found. Once it was pointed out, the “Sparks” authors responded by editing their arXiv novella first to disavow the racism in the 1997 editorial and then to remove the citation altogether. This, of course, left “Sparks” without a definition of the thing it claimed to be seeking (and finding!) in GPT-4 output.</mark>

<mark>Synthetic media creating non-consensual porn is existentially serious to its targets. Automated decision systems denying social benefits are existentially serious to those left without necessary supports. Shotspotter and similar technology that sends police in with the idea they are encountering a live shooter situation are existentially serious to Black and brown in the path of the police. False arrests mediated by face recognition system errors are existentially serious to the people arrested.</mark>

<mark>Hinton appears to be speaking from a mindset where violence is only worth speaking up over if it would kill off the entire human race. (Though elsewhere he suggests that climate change is an easier problem to solve, and therefore also not as serious?) It seems not irrelevant that Hinton holds enough privilege that he (and people like him) will be unlikely to experience harm from ‘AI’ unless everyone else on the planet does first.</mark>

<mark>On the other hand, it completely misses the point. Someone who genuinely wanted to work against racism (and any other system of oppression), upon learning that something they did contributes to (builds on, reinforces) a system of oppression, would be well served to investigate that further and see what needs to be done to stop the harm.</mark>
