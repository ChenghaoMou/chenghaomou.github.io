## Highlights
> The fundamental problem remains that, not knowing what words mean, it has no critical thinking abilities. This problem won’t be solved by training on larger databases or by being tweaked more vigorously by humans. I still believe that the best response by educators is to teach and test critical thinking skills. These are what students need and they can’t be reliably faked by LLMs.
