## Highlights
> The reality is that AI is like having a very eager junior developer on your team. They can write code quickly, but they need constant supervision and correction. The more you know, the better you can guide them.

> The very thing that makes AI coding tools accessible to non-engineers - their ability to handle complexity on your behalf - can actually impede learning. When code just "appears" without you understanding the underlying principles: * You don't develop debugging skills * You miss learning fundamental patterns * You can't reason about architectural decisions * You struggle to maintain and evolve the code This creates a dependency where you need to keep going back to AI to fix issues, rather than developing the expertise to handle them yourself.
