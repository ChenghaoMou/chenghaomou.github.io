## Highlights
<mark>If you ask ChatGPT in Tigrinya or Amharic the simplest and most frequently asked questions, it gives you gibberish, a mix of Tigrinya and Amharic, or even made-up words. Chatbots like ChatGPT are utterly broken or useless for these languages. Most of the data that powers them is basically internet data, and there is not enough data online for these languages. So it makes it even more urgent to create language-specific technologies.</mark>
