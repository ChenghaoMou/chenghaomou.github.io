## Highlights
<mark>Data Cards are transparency artifacts that provide structured summaries of ML datasets with explanations of processes and rationale that shape the data and describe how the data may be used to train or evaluate models. At minimum, Data Cards include the following: (1) upstream sources, (2) data collection and annotation methods, (3) training and evaluation methods, (4) intended use, and (5) decisions affecting model performance.</mark>

<mark>In practice, two critical factors determine the success of a transparency artifact, the ability to identify the information decision-makers use and the establishment of processes and guidance needed to acquire that information.</mark>
