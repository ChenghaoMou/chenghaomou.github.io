## Highlights
> * A pure function returns the same output given the same inputs.

> A pure function may be called any number of times without changing the system state

> The current knee-jerk reaction is to hide the I/O operations somewhere far away.

> This separation into an imperative shell and functional core is an encouraged idea by Functional Programming.

> The top-level procedure: 1. gets the input, 2. adapts it to simple objects acceptable to the system, 3. pushes it through the functional core, 4. gets the returned value from the functional core, 5. adapts it for the output device, 6. and pushes it out to the output device.
