## Highlights
<mark>Under the other pillow next to me, where no one sleeps. In other, more robust stretches, my phone spends the night plugged in about a foot away on the nightstand, and I can still reach it if I wake up and want to look at it, but it‚Äôs tethered. When I let it sleep freely with me, I can turn over while I look at it. I can look at it while I‚Äôm lying on my left side, and then I can turn over and look at it while I‚Äôm lying on my right side. I just charge it the next day, because it doesn‚Äôt matter if either of us is ready to go in the morning.</mark>

<mark>I‚Äôm not talking only about targeted ads; as they have become increasingly sophisticated, my sense of failure when I succumb to them has morphed into something more like begrudging respect. You got me, internet. I bought those Instagram jogging pants. I am no different from every other playable bundle of synapses holding a phone.</mark>

<mark>But it feels aggressive to me, in the way it would feel aggressive if suddenly every kind of advertisement everywhere you went in the world was designed only for you. When I say the new situation feels aggressive, I am anthropomorphizing the internet, but in theory the internet is a web of anthros, so that statement might be nonsensical. But is the internet the people? Or is it everything the people see and hear and know and make up, without the people?</mark>
<mark>I don‚Äôt ask people first. I always ask the internet first, both because I am afraid of people and because asking one person, or three, is asking one person or three, and asking the internet is asking all the people who have ever lived plus the endless expansion and iteration of their ideas, thanks to metastatic artificial intelligence.</mark>

<mark>When I Google anything, I think about the fewest possible, most unique words, arranged toward a limit of exclusive relevance, and I think of this as smooth-talking the internet. Doing as Moses was instructed, just asking the rock to give up the water; it will if you use the right words.</mark>

<mark>Like when Sydney says, ‚ÄúDo you believe me? Do you trust me? Do you like me? üò≥‚Äù that‚Äôs the mortal-biological-primate unit of code that underlies almost all of our actions, no matter how they‚Äôre flavored or dressed. It all comes back to do I have value, do I belong, am I good pretty popular safe kind smart ambitious relaxed enough.</mark>
