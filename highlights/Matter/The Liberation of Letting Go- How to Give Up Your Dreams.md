## Highlights

> Life isn't about picking the "right" dream to follow. Nope, that's not it at all. It's about figuring out which dreams to let go of. I know, I know, it sounds counterintuitive. But hear me out. It's not about addition; it's about subtraction.

> Choosing what to let go of isn't about settling for less. It's not about lowering your standards or accepting defeat. It's about getting real with yourself and aligning your actions with who you truly are and what you genuinely want out of life.

> The point is, just because you're excited about something doesn't mean it's a dream you should pursue. It's like being at an all-you-can-eat buffet. Sure, everything looks delicious, but if you try to eat it all, you'll end up feeling sick and miserable. The key is to choose the dishes that not only taste good but also nourish you in the long run.

> The trick is learning to tell the difference; developing the self-awareness to distinguish between a passing fancy and a true calling. And let me tell you, that's not always easy. We're experts at lying to ourselves, at convincing ourselves that we want things because we think we should want them.

> But your true dreams, the ones that align with your authentic self, have a different quality to them. They're not just exciting; they're energizing. They don't just sound good; they feel right. They're the dreams that you'd still want to pursue even if no one ever knew about them, even if you never got recognition or rewards.
