## Highlights
> I don’t know what word best describes my behavior above without inflecting significant value judgment. Perfectionist? Obsessive? Passionate? Whatever we call this compulsion, it’s hardly an unalloyed good and it comes with its share of downsides. Nevertheless, it’s one of a number of idiosyncrasies and character flaws I’ve decided to lean into and find productive outlets for rather than attempting to repress or rewire.

> * I’m a really bad learner—disinterested, distractible, and disagreeable. I’ve never enjoyed learning and generally avoid it, especially learning for its own sake. At the slightest discomfort when struggling to understand something, I’ll grasp for any distraction that might offer me a momentary escape. When I do manage to get traction, I inevitably find myself disagreeing with the premise or subversively trying to prove the authors wrong. The upshot is that once I actually do learn something, I know it cold. It means I will have scoured every nook and climbed out of every pitfall. Professionally, this apparent weakness has turned out to be a superpower. Learning everything the hard way has made me a natural consultant and mentor. Because I’ve already explored all the wrong paths, I often know someone is stuck before they do, understand what threw them off course, and show them how to get back on track

> it catapulted programming from a firmly middle class job that appealed to people who really loved computers into a comfortably upper-middle class profession that attracts anyone who wants to secure their financial future. Ask anyone who switched careers in the last decade how many times someone suggested they “learn to code.” Countless people are entering the industry simply because programming is a relatively secure, well-paying profession. (And there’s nothing wrong with that!)

> Sit with this distinction for a while, and you might start to see these old-hat programmers as belonging to an Enthusiast Generation, one that—due to its unique initial circumstances—is unlikely to be replicated. Once I introduced the word “generation” to my thinking, it became easier to make sense of many contentious, unresolved issues in tech that flared up over the past decade by looking at them through the lens of intergenerational conflict. And just like any discussion of generations, it’s important to caveat that there are no firm boundary lines, that exceptions are plentiful, and that many observations will be isolated to a single locale and culture (the U.S. in this case, maybe Canada?). The only thing that bucketing people into generations can do for us is provide a new way to look at how a population may be changing, thanks to a big enough time-step to perceive the accumulation of decades of gradual change.

> Tireless: spending more time practicing programming—not under coercion to work long hours, but being intrinsically motivated to do so—will generally make someone a better programmer * Tenacious: chasing down answers with limitless curiosity and relentless, no-holds-barred tenacity—whether or not it’s in their job description to spelunk open source stack traces or debug other teams’ code—will yield better information and faster progress * Thorough: priding oneself on the quality of one’s work and pursuing excellence in the (brace for it) craft—not falling victim to perfectionism, but cutting the right corners when necessary—will produce better-working software that’s easier to maintain
