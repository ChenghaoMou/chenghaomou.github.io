title: The Most Precious Resource is Agency

## Highlights
> Agency is the capacity to act. More subtly: An individual’s life can continue, with a certain inertia, that will lead them on to the next year or decade.

> Gaining agency is gaining the capacity to do something differently from, or in addition to, the events that simply happen to you.

> We do not need children to work, that is abundantly clear, but by ensuring there is nothing for them to do we are also sure to destroy more onramps towards making meaningful contributions to the world.

> Instead of an adolescence full of rites of passage, where one attempts to master something and accept responsibility, we have made it full of waiting, and doing work—for school is work—that nearly everyone knows is fake.

> Even for smart children, education endlessly ushers them towards an often far and always abstract future, so far and abstract that some children seem to apprise the opposite of agency, they take on a learned helplessness, and downplay that the future is a reality at all.

> The act of creation causes imagination, not the other way around. To understand this is to understand the ecology that fosters the unique.

> Learning is naturally the consequence of doing.
