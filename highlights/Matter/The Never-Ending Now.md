## Highlights
> The structure of our social media feeds place us in a Never-Ending Now. It sucks us into a temporal myopia. Like hamsters running on a wheel, we live in an endless cycle of ephemeral content consumption — a merry-go-round that spins faster and faster but never goes anywhere.

> Here’s Tim Wu writing in The Attention Merchants: *“Any and all information that one consumes—pays attention to—will have some influence… As William James observed,*we must reflect that, when we reach the end of our days, our life experience will equal what we have paid attention to, whether by choice or default.We are at risk, without quite fully realizing it, of living lives that are less our own than we imagine.”
