## Highlights
> One should always worry when a person or an organization places one value above all. The moral fabric of our world is complex. Itâ€™s nuanced. Sensitivity to moral nuance is difficult, but unwavering support of one principle to rule them all is morally dangerous.

> Instead, we have a technologically driven shift of power to ideological individuals and organizations whose lack of appreciation for moral nuance and good governance puts us all at risk.
