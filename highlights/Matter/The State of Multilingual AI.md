## Highlights
> The curse of multilinguality Why do these models only cover up to 100 languages? One reason is the 'curse of multilinguality' . Similar to models that are trained on many tasks, the more languages a model is pre-trained on, the less model capacity is available to learn representations for each language. Increasing the size of a model ameliorates this to some extent, enabling the model to dedicate more capacity to each language .
