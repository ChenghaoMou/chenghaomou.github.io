## Highlights
<mark>The Trap of the Inner Ring No matter where we find ourselves in society, there is always a more exclusive group to join and someone of higher status to compare ourselves with.</mark>

<mark>The Body-Builder Trap This brings us to the second pitfall of status: When we seek status as a way to escape feelings of “not-enoughness,” we often reinforce the core underlying belief that something is wrong with us. Take the example of a bodybuilder who exercises from a place of hating their body and wanting it to change. Even if they do get in shape, this only serves to reinforce the link between body image and self-worth in their mind, leaving them hypersensitive to minor fluctuations in weight and anything that feels like a potential “flaw.”</mark>

<mark>The Trap of False Belonging Finally, the third pitfall of status is that it gets in the way of experiencing true belonging. When we fear rejection, this can bring up feelings of deficiency or lack. These feelings, in turn, can hold us back from creating intimate connections with others, for fear of being judged or rejected.</mark>

<mark>In a status-oriented exposure, we do exactly what we did above—we bring to mind a situation that raises challenging thoughts and feelings, and then we turn toward them, rather than trying to avoid or escape from them. By dipping our toes into the pool of anxiety and willingly contacting those thoughts and feelings, we learn to tolerate shame and insecurity as normal parts of a human life.</mark>

<mark>Studies have shown that taking a stressful or traumatic event and writing about it for ~20 minutes for three or four consecutive days can have a significant impact on well-being.</mark>

<mark>When we are consumed by status, our lives become about managing our insecurities. So the question becomes: If you weren’t so busy trying to prove your worth through status games, what would you want your life to be in service of?</mark>

<mark>Status, like money and power, is a form of capital. If we can learn to tolerate our feelings of “not-enoughness,” we can then use status in service of what we care about, rather than being addicted to it as an end in itself.</mark>
