## Highlights

> Instead of substituting what someone else is saying with a lousy proposition, we’ll do better by reinforcing their basic argument. This is known as the Steel Man Technique. Put simply, it’s building the best form of the other side’s argument and then engaging with it. It’s being charitable and patching up the weaknesses in the other side’s proposition so that he can bring the best counter-argument to your point of view.

> If you can state opposing views as clearly and persuasive as your opponents, you pass. You’re as good an emissary of that idea as anyone. That’s the standard we should be striving for. As John Stuart Mill said, “he who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.”
