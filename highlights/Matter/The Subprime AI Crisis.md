## Highlights

> OpenAI is shoving Strawberry out the door as a means of proving to investors (and the greater public) that the AI revolution is still here, and what they have is a clunky, unexciting and expensive model.

> If the combined forces of every venture capitalist and big tech hyperscaler have yet to come up with a meaningful use case that lots of people will actually pay for, there isn't one coming. Large Language Models — and yes, that's where all of these billions of dollars are going — are not going to magically sprout new capabilities because big tech and OpenAI sunk another $150 billion into them. Nobody is trying to make these things more efficient, or at the very least nobody has succeeded in doing so. If they had, they'd be shouting it from the rooftops.
