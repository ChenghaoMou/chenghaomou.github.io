## Highlights

> Indeed, there is emerging evidence from neuroscience that language fluency is surprisingly disassociated from other aspects of cognition. MIT neuroscientist Ev Fedorenko and her collaborators have shown in a series of careful and compelling experiments that the brain networks underlying what they call “formal linguistic competence”—the abilities related to language production—are largely separate from the networks underlying common sense, reasoning, and other aspects of what we might call “thinking.” Our intuitive assumption that fluent language is a sufficient condition for general intelligence is, these researchers claim, a “fallacy.”
