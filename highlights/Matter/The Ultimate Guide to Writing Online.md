## Highlights
> Many writers suffer from perfectionism, where they refuse to share ideas until they're perfect. Perfectionism is particularly pernicious because it's a vice that looks like a virtue. It's the child of two parents: fear and narcissism. It's dangerous because you can rationalize away your fears with the excuse that your standards are higher than everybody else's. To shake the temptations of perfectionism, I share half-baked ideas all the time. Doing so helps my writing because I can run ideas through numerous filters, such as blogs, tweets, and email newsletters. By the time I've published an essay like this one, I've run the ideas through various forms of low-cost, high-speed trial-and-error. Each time I receive feedback, I keep more of what resonates and less of what doesn't.

> "Friend Brain" is our natural way of speaking. It comes easily to us in conversation, and it knows how to party. It's the friend your Mom warned you about --- the one who was super mischievous and high-agency and gave you that intrepid spirit. Conversations with trusted friends awaken your primal nature. They're arson for your scared and timid self --- the weakling inside of you that cares too much about what other people think. Only with trusted friends can you speak with an unfiltered and passionate fury. Cry. Scream. Rile yourself up. Rant like a Jewish grandmother. And if you really need to, get whiskey drunk and see what spills out after drink #3. In these moments of sweltering honesty, once we've freed ourselves from a self-induced prison of the mind, we're able to unleash brave and surprising ideas.
