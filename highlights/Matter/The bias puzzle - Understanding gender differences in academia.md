## Highlights
<mark>In our recent work, we propose to define bias as an unjustified direct causal effect. This is a fairly technical definition, based on ideas from the field of causal inference. The essence of this definition is that there is a bias in the treatment of people with a particular characteristic, such as a particular gender, if they are unjustifiably treated differently because of that characteristic. For example, we say there is a gender bias in funding if the exact same grant proposal, with the same CV and the same track record, would be funded if the proposal were written by a man instead of a woman (or the other way around). If the exact same proposal is evaluated the same, regardless of the gender of the applicant, there is no gender bias.</mark>

<mark>Even though there is no gender bias in funding, the gender bias in hiring at the prestigious institution has a negative indirect effect on the chances of women to receive funding. To distinguish this indirect effect from a direct effect, we call the indirect effect a gender disparity in funding, not a gender bias.</mark>

<mark>Just as correlation does not imply causation, our definition of bias highlights that gender differences do not imply gender biases. This is why controlling for confounding variables is necessary to make correct inferences about gender biases. At the same time, controlling for the wrong variables leads to incorrect inferences.</mark>

<mark>Consider again the above-mentioned case of gender bias in hiring, in which women have to pass a higher bar than men to be hired at a prestigious institution. A consequence of this gender bias is that women hired at the prestigious institution will on average be better qualified than men. As a result, relatively more women than men will receive funding at this institution, as shown in the above figure. This gender difference in funding does not imply a gender bias against men in the funding competition. It is simply a consequence of the gender bias against women in hiring.</mark>
