## Highlights

> Critique without constructive direction is just complaining, and adds constraint to the author without also helping with momentum.

> And so, I’ve learned that a person can absorb only about one piece of feedback per interaction, and then only if it’s labeled very specifically as feedback with the best intentions, and wrapped delicately in a feedback sandwich. Because of this volume constraint, infrequent feedback must be more general and higher level, ideally accompanied by impersonal assets like a blogpost that the recipient of the feedback can read separately (this is partially why I write blogposts).
