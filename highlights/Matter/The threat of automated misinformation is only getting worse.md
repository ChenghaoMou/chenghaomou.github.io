## Highlights
<mark>The bad news is that with the right invocations, a bad actor could easily get around the guardrails, using what Oakley describes as “standard techniques”. For obvious reasons I don’t care to share the details. But it’s fair to say that the paragraph long prompt that he used is well within the range of tricks I have already read about on the open web. What’s even more disturbing is that Bing makes it look like the false narrative that it generates is referenced. The potential for automatically generating misinformation at scale is only getting worse.</mark>
