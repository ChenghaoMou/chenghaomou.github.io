## Highlights
> “Who gets to be the arbiter of truth? Who gets to decide what can and cannot be seen?” Chowdhury asks about that experiment. “So at the end of the day, the power of owning and running a social media platform is exactly that. You decide what’s important, and that is so dangerous in the wrong hands.”

> “It is unsurprising that if you look at the race and, generally, gender demographics of Doomer or existentialist people, they look a particular way, they are of a particular income level. Because they don’t often suffer structural inequality — they’re either wealthy enough to get out of it, or white enough to get out of it, or male enough to get out of it,” says Chowdhury. “So for these individuals, they think that the biggest problems in the world are can AI set off a nuclear weapon?”

> “I’ve been really concerned about the inability of humans generally, but members of marginalized communities specifically, to lose the capacity to refuse or resist or decline the technologies that are handed to them,” Gangadharan says. “So with LLM and generative AI, we have a new, more complex, and more seemingly inevitable technology being thrust in our faces.… Agencies are going to turn to a tool that promises efficiencies and cost savings like AI. Right? They are also sold as tools that will eliminate human bias or human error. These institutions, whether government or private institutions, they’re going to rely on these tools more and more. What can end up happening is that certain populations become the guinea pigs of these technologies, or conversely, they become the cheap labor to power these technologies.”
