## Highlights

> In the shuttle group’s culture, there are no superstar programmers. The whole approach to developing software is intentionally designed not to rely on any particular person.

> How do they write the right stuff? The answer is, it’s the process. The group’s most important creation is not the perfect software they write — it’s the process they invented that writes the perfect software.

> It’s the process that allows them to live normal lives, to set deadlines they actually meet, to stay on budget, to deliver software that does exactly what it promises. It’s the process that defines what these coders in the flat plains of southeast suburban Houston know that everyone else in the software world is still groping for. It’s the process that offers a template for any creative enterprise that’s looking for a method to produce consistent – and consistently improving — quality.

> The process can be reduced to four simple propositions: 1. The product is only as good as the plan for the product. At the on-board shuttle group, about one-third of the process of writing software happens before anyone writes a line of code.

> 2. The best teamwork is a healthy rivalry. Within the software group, there are subgroups and subcultures. But what could be divisive office politics in other organizations is actually a critical part of the process.

> The central group breaks down into two key teams: the coders – the people who sit and write code — and the verifiers — the people who try to find flaws in the code. The two outfits report to separate bosses and function under opposing marching orders.

> The development group is supposed to deliver completely error-free code, so perfect that the testers find no flaws at all. The testing group is supposed to pummel away at the code with flight scenarios and simulations that reveal as many flaws as possible. The result is what Tom Peterson calls “a friendly adversarial relationship.”

> The verifiers, in turn, argue that they deserve credit for some errors found before they even start testing. “From the verification group’s perspective,” says Pat McLellan, a senior manager, “we’re aware that if there was no independent verification group, the developers would tend to be more lax. Just the presence of our group makes them more careful.”

> 4. Don’t just fix the mistakes — fix whatever permitted the mistake in the first place.

> The way the process works, it not only finds errors in the software. The process finds errors in the process.

> Software is getting more and more common and more and more important, but it doesn’t seem to be getting more and more reliable.
