title: This Is Too Important to Leave to Microsoft, Google and Facebook

## Highlights
> This technology is too important to be left to a race between Microsoft, Google, Meta and a few other firms. But no one company can slow down to a safe pace without risking irrelevancy. That’s where the government comes in — or so they hope.

> In trying to regulate systems by use case, the Artificial Intelligence Act ends up saying very little about how to regulate the underlying model that’s powering all these use cases.

> But where the European Commission’s approach is much too tailored, the White House blueprint may well be too broad. No A.I. system today comes close to adhering to the framework, and it’s not clear that any of them could.

> Right now, the testing done to make sure large models are safe is voluntary, opaque and inconsistent. No best practices have been accepted across the industry, and not nearly enough work has been done to build testing regimes in which the public can have confidence.

> The way to make A.I. systems safe is to give the companies that design the models a good reason to make them safe. Making them bear at least some liability for what their models do would encourage a lot more caution.
