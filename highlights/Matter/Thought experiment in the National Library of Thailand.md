## Highlights
> Without any way to relate the texts you are looking at to anything outside language, i.e. to hypotheses about their communicative intent, you can’t get off the ground with this task. Most of the strategies above involve pulling in additional information that would let you make those hypotheses — something beyond the strict form of the language. You could, if you didn’t get fed up, get really good as knowing what a reasonable string of Thai “looks like”. You could maybe even write something that a Thai speaker could make sense of. But this isn’t the same thing as “knowing Thai”. If you wanted to learn from the knowledge stored in that library, you still wouldn’t have access.
