## Highlights
<mark>Don’t forget the why. The paper needs to be clear about 1) what are the research questions it attempts to answer; and 2) why they are important. Make sure the introduction answers the “why” questions before diving into the “how” questions.</mark>

<mark>In the paper, it’s important that you only describe what’s relevant, excluding some (often most) of the work you’ve done. Although research tends to involve many failed attempts and detours before landing on a successful idea, academic papers are structured as if you’ve had the one successful idea from the start.</mark>

<mark>Don’t dilute your high quality solution with mediocre intermediate steps. Sometimes it’s better to leave some ideas out, or to separate them to another paper.</mark>

<mark>This advice applies to any genre of writing. It’s cognitively difficult to understand long sentences. Split them into multiple short sentences.</mark>

<mark>Quotation marks in LaTex are different. Opening quotation is `` and closing quotation is ’’. If you copy from a Google doc or some other document, make sure to replace the quotes. (For single quotes use ` and ‘).</mark>

<mark>Cite the correct version of the paper. Google Scholar often defaults to the arXiv version, but you should check if the paper has since been accepted at another venue (journal or conference), and cite that version instead.</mark>
