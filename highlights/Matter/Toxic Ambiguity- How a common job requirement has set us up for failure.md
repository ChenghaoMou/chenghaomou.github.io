## Highlights

> In the workplace, this toxic ambiguity has manifested itself as a scapegoat for lack of accountability, leadership presence, clear and informed decision-making, and properly allocated resources.

> Employers often use ambiguity as an excuse or justification about the state of their business or product. Perhaps nowhere is this more egregious than in the startup world, where “thriving in ambiguity” really means no one has any idea what’s going on and you might have to do six jobs outside of your job title, all while getting constantly mixed or absent signals from leadership.

> * Honesty. Are there measures taking place to actively reduce ambiguity? A team that has a healthy relationship with ambiguity will share the current ambiguity status with you, rather than expecting you to thrive in it without end.

> * Clear processes. A lack of process or team role functions can exacerbate ambiguity on a team. If there are already healthy processes in place, or an agreed-upon engagement model, this is a good sign.
