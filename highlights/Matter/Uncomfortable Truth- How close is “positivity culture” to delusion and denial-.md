## Highlights

> Real friendships and relationships aren’t about what happens when things are happy and convenient; they’re about what happens during difficulty, strife, and inconvenience. Who are you when things get hard?

> Another, congruent view is articulated in “The Opposite of Toxic Positivity: ‘Tragic optimism’ is the search for meaning during the inevitable tragedies of human existence, and is better for us than avoiding darkness and trying to ‘stay positive.’” “Tragic optimism” seems to me close to a stoic attitude, which admits sadness into life without being dominated by sadness.

> But negativity isn’t always wrong or pathological, and improvements come from realizing something is not going right and then fixing it. Or recognizing that something can’t be fixed, and the time is now to sit with the unhappiness.
