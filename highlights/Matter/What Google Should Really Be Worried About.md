## Highlights
<mark>Large Language Models (like GPT-3, ChatGPT, Galactica, etc) could be used to produce a enormous numbers of marginal blogs and fake reviews to pump each other up, and increase the search rankings of fraudulent garbage—with a minimal amount of human effort. Why manually write cesspools of interconnected likes, when an LLM can do that job for you? LLMs aren’t very good at writing error free prose, but the people who run content farms won’t care about the errors. what used to be written laboriously by humans suddenly becomes cheap and hence more widespread.</mark>
