## Highlights
<mark>This is why, if you read the Biblical-VCR case study carefully, you’ll soon realize that the advice given, though impressive in style, doesn’t actually solve the original problem very well. ChatGPT suggests sticking a knife between the sandwich and VCR, to “pry them apart.” Even a toddler can deduce that this technique won’t work well for something jammed inside a confined slot. The obvious solution would be to pull the sandwich out, but ChatGPT has no actual conception of what it’s talking about—no internal model of a stuck sandwich on which it can experiment with different strategies for removal. The A.I. is simply remixing and recombining existing writing that’s relevant to the prompt. Similar tells emerge in that clever “Seinfeld” script about the bubble-sort algorithm. Read it to the end, and you’ll discover characters spouting non sequiturs: Elaine, for no particular reason, orders chicken salad from a passing waiter, and this is described as causing “audience laughter.” ChatGPT doesn’t understand humor in any fundamental sense, because its neural networks have encoded only what a sitcom script is supposed to sound like.</mark>
