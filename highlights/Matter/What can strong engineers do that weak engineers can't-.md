## Highlights
> Ironically, while people like this exist at almost all seniority levels, you’re more likely to encounter weak engineers in senior roles. I think this is probably for two reasons. First, the bar to hire juniors is explicitly capability-based, so it’s harder to slip past it. In interviews, seniors can talk about work they were tangentially involved with, which is hard to distinguish from work they did. Second, a weak junior is often given more opportunity to learn, because it’s socially acceptable for them to not know things. A weak senior has to conceal their lack of knowledge and learn in secret, which is much harder.

> One way to tell a weak engineer in a discussion thread about some problem is to see who is bringing in specific facts about how the system currently works, and who is making purely general recommendations that could apply to any system. If their messages could all be public tweets, they’re probably not adding much value.
