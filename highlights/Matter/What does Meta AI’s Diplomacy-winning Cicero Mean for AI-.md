title: What does Meta AI’s Diplomacy-winning Cicero Mean for AI?
---

## Highlights
> The first is that Cicero’s overall architecture Is not something that simply emerged spontaneously from the basic data, but it is rather an exquisitely engineered structure with many moving parts, laboriously worked out by a broad team of different types of AI experts, combining techniques from game theory with probabilistic analysis.

> is, to what extent do the techniques that have been used in Cicero generalize to other situations involving action and social interactions? What aspects of Cicero’s execution architecture, training architecture, or general methodological approach will be useful if we want to build an AI that is useful for some complex interaction with people outside the closed and limited world of Diplomacy?
