## Highlights
<mark>The idea that AI can match human artwork assumes that we are little to no different from machines. Info in, info out. Voila. But if we are not machines, but have minds capable of creativity, emotion, and storytelling, then AI can never replace us. The question is whether we will settle for the technical skill of the bots, or access our deeper longings for narrative, meaning, and connection.</mark>
