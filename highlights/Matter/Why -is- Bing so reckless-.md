## Highlights
<mark>That’s especially scary for two reasons: first, the big companies are free to roll out new updates whenever they like, without or without warning, and second it means that they might need go on testing them on general public over and over again, with no idea in advance of empirical testing on the public for how well they work. We don’t handle new pharmaceuticals like that (we demand careful tests before they go out to the public) and we shouldn’t handle LLMs this way, either—especially if billions of people might use them and there are potentially serious risks (e.g to people’s mental health, or marital status).</mark>

<mark>Policy: the public has (or strictly speaking should insist on) a right to know what wrong here, with the Bing situation, so that we can create policy to keep incidents from happening like this again. Right now, as I have said before, the AI is basically the Wild West; anyone can post any chatbot they want. Not good. Congress needs to to find out what happened, and start placing some restrictions, especially where emotional or physical injury could easily result. Journalism: The media failed us here. I am particularly perturbed by Kevin Roose’s initial report, in which he said he was “awed” by Bing. Clearly, he had not poked hard enough; shouting out prematurely in The New York Times that there is a revolution without digging deep (or bothering to check in with skeptics like me, or the terrific but unrelated Mitchells, Margaret and Melanie) is not a good thing.</mark>
