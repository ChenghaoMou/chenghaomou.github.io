title: Why ChatGPT Won’t Replace Google
---

## Highlights
> With Google, the algorithm eventually leads you to content made by real people. With ChatGPT, you never leave the algorithm

> Being computers, neither Google nor ChatGPT cares about the truth. They are algorithms, and they merely do as they are told.

> Google eventually lets you out of its system.

> Ultimately, Google points users to websites which are run by people who do care about the truth, while ChatGPT keeps you tied to the algorithm, which does not.
