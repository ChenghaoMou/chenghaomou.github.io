## Highlights

> Over time, this could lead to developers who can’t effectively solve problems without an AI’s assistance because they never fully developed the problem-solving and critical-thinking skills necessary for programming.

> Without proper vetting, programmers might accept inefficient, buggy, or insecure code that works at first glance but causes problems in the long run. This reliance reduces the incentive to refactor or even review the code, which could harm the codebase and team productivity over time.

> Ultimately, it’s the developer’s job to review, understand, and refine the code, but with the convenience of Copilot, that diligence might fade.

> However, by providing quick solutions, Copilot and other LLMs may shortcut the learning process, giving developers answers without requiring them to dig deeper into why certain solutions work or don’t work.

> This convenience, while beneficial in the short term, reduces the number of learning experiences that contribute to long-term skill development.

> The fear is that AI tools might cause programming to become a more mechanical process of accepting suggestions rather than a creative pursuit that pushes boundaries.

> When developers start using these tools, they become increasingly reliant on them to generate, troubleshoot, or optimise their code. This creates a problem when the tools fail, change their terms of service, or become too expensive.

> A developer might feel proficient in programming because they can quickly generate working code with the help of Copilot, even if they don’t fully understand the code.
