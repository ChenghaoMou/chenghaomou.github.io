## Highlights
<mark>That said basically, four students who have essentially the same SAT or ACT scores—so look at two applicants who have the same test scores—if an applicant is from a family from the top 1 percent of the income distribution, they’re more than twice as likely to be admitted as an applicant, again, with the same test scores, who’s from a middle-class family.</mark>

<mark>But the answer is yes, it actually is really worth it. Students who are admitted off the wait list to one of these schools, compared to students who are rejected off the wait list, are about 60 percent more likely to be in the top 1 percent of income at age 33 themselves. They’re twice as likely to be at a top 10 graduate school, and they’re about three times as likely to work for a prestigious firm in a variety of sectors. Think about top law firms, top consulting firms, research hospitals, prestigious universities, and so on. So it really does seem to make a difference, and that was surprising.</mark>
