## Highlights
<mark>you also paid an attention tax in lost time and productivity that’s no less real but much more difficult to quantify.</mark>

<mark>Interruptions aren’t just external. We’re actually just as likely to interrupt ourselves as we are to be interrupted.</mark>

<mark>In The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains, Nicholas Carr explains how our brain, through neuroplasticity, adapts in response to changes in our environment, like technology innovations, which means we gain and lose certain skills. Social media, email, and team communications tools stimulate our very human desire to want to connect with people and access novel information but diminish the focus and processing skills that our literacy culture of books and newspapers built up.</mark>

<mark>“[E]ach interruption brings us a valuable piece of information… And so we ask the Internet to keep interrupting us, in ever more and different ways. We willingly accept the loss of concentration and focus, the division of our attention and the fragmentation of our thoughts, in return for the wealth of compelling or at least diverting information we receive.”</mark>

<mark>When we context switch, our brains receive multiple stimuli at once. This leads to a “response selection bottleneck” that slows thought and decision-making. Upon returning to a task after a distraction, it can take up to 23 minutes to re-focus. Even “brief mental blocks” as a result of switching can take as much as 40% of a person’s productive time.</mark>

<mark>We can hold between 3 and 7 pieces of information at a time. By flooding us with new information, context switching takes away the brain space we need to retain and process the information we were already dealing with.</mark>

<mark>With diminished capacity to step back, strategize, and focus on higher priorities, we default to working on more immediate, low-value tasks, like responding to emails as they come in. We also revert to “survival mode,” where our instinct is to compensate for our stress by accomplishing something — anything. However, in our depleted capacity we go for the low-hanging fruit — again, those emails, which we can easily send — instead of writing a report, or reading an article, which takes more time and thought.</mark>

<mark>finishing work earlier so it doesn’t bleed into our leisure time, putting us into the zone of deep work or flow that allows us to do our best work, and bringing ourselves just a bit more calm in a noisy world. Here are nine concrete strategies to incorporate into your day:</mark>

<mark>However, when your priorities aren’t clear, deciding what to do can become its own distraction. Get clear on what’s important to you with a go-to framework you can apply over and over again to decide what to focus on.</mark>

<mark>Social beats solo. Research in South Korean workplaces shows that social breaks — talking with coworkers about something other than work — are more effective at reducing stress and improving mood than either cognitive breaks (answering e-mail) or nutrition breaks (getting a snack).</mark>

<mark>Try to focus on one task, screen, app, and window at a time, and eliminate what causes you to switch contexts in the first place — the buzzes and screen notifications and excess tabs in your web browser:</mark>

<mark>It’s a natural impulse to want to respond to things as soon as they come in. You don’t want to hold things up, and it feels good to have one less message in the inbox. But you may be sending a message that people should always expect a quick response from you, which can lead to getting more emails and more context switches.</mark>

<mark>While it may feel like a matter of personal failing, all of us living and working in digital environments and interruption-heavy work cultures experience it, especially those working from home and caring for children or other family members right now.</mark>
