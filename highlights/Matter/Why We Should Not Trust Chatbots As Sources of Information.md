## Highlights
<mark>The result is systems that can produce text that is very compelling when we as humans make sense of it. But the systems do not have any understanding of what they are producing, any communicative intent, any model of the world, or any ability to be accountable for the truth of what they are saying.</mark>

<mark>But the extracts the chatbot grabs from vast troves and arranges according to rules of syntax are not the result of an intelligent process. No one is in charge of it — unless, of course, there is a human in the loop, listening in. But then the session with the chatbot is no longer an interaction with a supercomputer alone.</mark>

<mark>There will never be an all-inclusive fully correct set of information that represents everything we could need to know. And even if you might hope that could come to pass, it should be very clear that today’s World Wide Web isn’t it. When people seek information, we might think we have a question and we are looking for the answer, but more often than not, we benefit more from engaging in sense-making: refining our question, looking at possible answers, understanding the sources those answers come from and what perspectives they represent, etc.</mark>

<mark>To the Centers for Disease Control, for example, information about myocarditis as an outcome of the vaccine against COVID-19 was long treated as “misinformation.” But the agency now admits that the concerns are legitimate. Thus, if the information seeker is in a risk category for myocarditis, even government agencies may not have been providing a picture that allows for risk assessment. We must often take the risk of searching in a variety of places for answers that meet a need.</mark>

<mark>“It is urgent that we recognize that an overlay of apparent fluency does not, despite appearances, entail accuracy, informational value, or trustworthiness”</mark>
