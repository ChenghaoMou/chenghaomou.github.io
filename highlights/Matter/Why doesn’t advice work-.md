## Highlights

> Maybe your advice is incomplete without your lived experience.

> Maybe people ignore your advice because they don’t understand it.

> Maybe ignoring stuff we don’t understand is a cognitive bias. I suspect this bias has an evil sibling: Our brains often make us not understand advice that we don’t want to follow.

> Maybe people can’t follow your advice because they don’t feel like it will work.

> Maybe your advice requires a lot of willpower.

> Maybe we don’t care so much if advice is useful. Maybe we ask for advice because we want reassurance that our pre-determined choices are right. If you ask enough people, eventually someone will give you validation.

> Probably everyone has some issues and struggles to deal with some things. Maybe the same issues that make them need your advice also make them unable to use it.
