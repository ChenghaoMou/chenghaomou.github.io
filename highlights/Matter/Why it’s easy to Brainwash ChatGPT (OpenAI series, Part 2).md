## Highlights
<mark>It’s very human to think in terms of narratives or frameworks, and when there are contradictory ideas in those frameworks, most people experience some kind of cognitive dissonance. GPT, or other ML models, do not experience this resistance. In some cases, this is preferable. It’s much more able to summarize a wide array of differing perspectives on the same topic in a way that very few humans are able to.</mark>
