## Highlights
<mark>Have something to say</mark>

<mark>The goal of writing is to deliver a message to an audience in an effective way.</mark>

<mark>If you don’t have a clear message in your head, your are not ready to start writing a narrative yet.</mark>

<mark>In fact, writing is a great test to see if you have a good understanding of a topic, and have a firm grasp on the vocabulary of the domain.</mark>

<mark>Writing is god’s way to show you how imperfect your thoughts are.</mark>

<mark>An argument is only half as good once you are uttering it.</mark>

<mark>The better you know and understand your audience the easier it will be to reach the goal of delivering a message to them.</mark>

<mark>When writing an article, I generally visualize a concrete person as representative of the audience, that I am directing this text towards.</mark>

<mark>Prepare for a writing task, like you would for a hike. You are in for a grind. Find a comfortable space to sit. Grab a beverage/snack of your preference. Most importantly make sure that you are rested and able to focus.</mark>

<mark>If you have loaded a lot of useful context in your brain at any given point in time, use this context to do something useful with it. Try to milk that moment, and make space when you realize you are in a position to write effectively on your topic.</mark>

<mark>Conversely, if you don’t have the context in your brain right now, you have two options (1) don’t write or (2) start loading the context into your brain.</mark>

<mark>Good ways to load some context are: 1. Go through your notes that you took about the topic. 2. Discuss the topic with a coworker / random stranger / family member. 3. Read some books / blogs / papers on the topic.</mark>

<mark>A outline should be the first milestone for any larger document you are writing. The outline, should convey the main message and provide a clear “red thread” that guides your reader through your argument.</mark>

<mark>The first milestone for your document is an outline. Everything that is not directly contributing to this goal is a distraction.</mark>

<mark>the second milestone is a fully fleshed out text, where all notes have been converted to paragraphs.</mark>

<mark>If you want your voice to be heard (and also improve the usability of your text) you have to design your document for “skim-ability”.</mark>

<mark>Section Headings and Lists are the key anchor points you want to use to reach this goal. Also Figures, Quotes and Highlights are features that stand out and grab attention while skimming.</mark>

<mark>Generally, I would recommend to start working on summary sections (like Abstract/Conclusion) last, since only then will you be certain what your document actually covers.</mark>

<mark>The only way to improve your writing is by writing. As with practice in general, valuing quantity over quality is generally a good idea.</mark>

<mark>Once you have constructed an outline and polished the story-line you are at a great place to get initial feedback on your document. This allows you to uncover flaws in your story-line early, and make sure you are on-target with the content.</mark>

<mark>Once you fleshed out the content, and did a first editing pass removing the most glaring grammar and spelling mistakes, you are at a good point to sent the document to a few selected members of the target audience. This practice has three benefits: 1. You will get a pair of fresh eyes on the text that will at the very least catch a few grammar quirks that remained in the text. 2. You take a break from working on the text yourself, until you received the feedback, allowing yourself to take a fresh look at your writing. 3. You have an excuse to reach out to old friends that you had neglected for far too long.</mark>
