title: "Writing is Like Entering a Huge Country- How I Found My Way"

## Highlights
<mark>Learning what writers value in their writing lives and what sparked particular pieces of their writing and studying the craft in a hands-on way in writers’ workshops helped me pay attention to my own processes and gain confidence. It helped me realize many of the same things happened to me as I wrote. It helped me learn that when we start a piece of writing we don’t know all we will know when we finish it.</mark>

<mark>For me, setting about to write anything is like learning how to visit a foreign country. I feel more comfortable now knowing there is much I have yet to learn. I find surprises and new roads and bridges, meadows and mountains to navigate. The country of creative writing is an exciting one every time I visit, demanding I start off not knowing so I can end up richer with the knowledge I didn’t have before I wrote. It is my favorite country to visit, and I go there as often as I can.</mark>
