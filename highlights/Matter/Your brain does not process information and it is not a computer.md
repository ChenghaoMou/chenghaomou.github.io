## Highlights
<mark>Senses, reflexes and learning mechanisms – this is what we start with, and it is quite a lot, when you think about it.</mark>

<mark>But here is what we are not born with: information, data, rules, software, knowledge, lexicons, representations, algorithms, programs, models, memories, images, processors, subroutines, encoders, decoders, symbols, or buffers – design elements that allow digital computers to behave somewhat intelligently. Not only are we not born with such things, we also don’t develop them – ever.</mark>

<mark>Setting aside the formal language, the idea that humans must be information processors just because computers are information processors is just plain silly,</mark>
