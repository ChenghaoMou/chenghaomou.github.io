## Highlights

> There is a sweetness tasted not just in success, but in enjoying the searches and quests themselves, and in maintaining a wistful imagination. The threat of failure is necessary to accept these benefits. If you cultivate only defense, you will not cultivate the others.

> Delight in romance — in the literary sense, or the physical, or something more mysterious — cannot be bought on a defensive budget. It requires an openness to desire, a willingness to work with the parts of the world we cannot directly control, and to make a virtue of curiosity.
