> But these claims are unfounded hype. Instead, so-called labor-saving devices will enable regimes of austerity and profit-maximization, that is, a marked decline in social services and weakened regulation in emerging markets. Rather than meet societal obligations to invest in education and physical and mental care, AI’s advocates risk creating a two-tier system where artificial facsimiles will be deemed good enough for those without means—but the well-to-do will hire actual humans. The flimsiness of their fantasy becomes clearer when one actually tries to imagine AI models excelling at the labor at the heart of our societies: carework, agriculture, and infrastructure repair and management.
