## Highlights
> Let's be real – you're probably feeling the compounding effect of presenteeism. It's the idea that your productivity and performance are enhanced by the fact that you're physically present at work.

> A 2014 study from Stanford University proved that productivity per hour sharply declines when a person works more than 50 hours per week. After 55 hours of work per week, productivity was found to be essentially non-existent.

> But self-awareness of when you’re actually busy versus when you feel you need to say you’re busy is vital.
