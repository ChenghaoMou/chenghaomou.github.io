## Highlights

> Remember, you should **use your technical skills to deliver business value rather than as an end in themselves.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-art-of-getting-promoted-by-rafa-paez-18d6bf7187e#d6a58582-8d78-4472-816e-e245ac638b30)  ^d6a58582

> **Self-promotion is essential**, especially in today's remote work environment. Don't assume your manager is aware of all your contributions. Ensure you showcase your hard work and impact to gain recognition. Otherwise, forget to be rewarded and say goodbye to potential promotions.

> Remember, if you want to maximize the options **to get promoted**, focus on the following:
> 
> 1. **Deliver business value**
> 2. **Make your work visible** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-art-of-getting-promoted-by-rafa-paez-18d6bf7187e#efa0ebb1-427b-4510-bec4-4319eccfc58c)  ^efa0ebb1
