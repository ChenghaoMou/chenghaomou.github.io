## Highlights

> Quora’s shrinking utility isn’t due entirely to A.I.: Longtime writers cite issues with moderation and functionality that started well before the ChatGPT era. But its decline has been accelerating—much to the chagrin of the uniquely attached and now-fraying community—with the rise of this new knowledge broker. Earlier this month, the A.I.–accelerationist venture capital hub [Andreessen Horowitz](https://slate.com/technology/2023/11/openai-sam-altman-ai-microsoft-eacc-effective-altruism.html) blessed Quora with a much-needed [$75 million investment](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/quora-75m-funding-a16z-poe-ai-chat/)—but _only_ for the sake of developing its on-site generative-text chatbot, Poe.

> The tragedy of Quora is not just that it crushed the flourishing communities it once built up. It’s that it took all of that goodwill, community, expertise, and curiosity and assumed that it could automate a system that equated it, apparently without much thought to how pale the comparison is.
