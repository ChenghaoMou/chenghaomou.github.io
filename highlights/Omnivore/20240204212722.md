## Highlights

> **Digitopia (pronunciation: dij-i-toh-pee-uh)** — an idealized but ultimately isolating and detached state induced by excessive digital interaction. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/deeshee-digitopia-is-ruining-our-lives-18d75c9f6b7#48248f4f-aff1-4ea2-80ba-267f05a4959c)  ^48248f4f

> There are multiple factors that drive depression such as isolation; which often stems from being constantly alone, indoors and/or having a fake sense of “being social” by socializing with strangers on the internet, lack of confidence; stemming from comparing ourselves to others, letting go of ourselves and avoiding basic hygiene, grasping for quick dopamine hits or actions that yield in sweeping the “depressive” thoughts under a rug, and so on, and so forth.

> Being in the Digitopian state usually means living on autopilot. Grabbing one thing after the other, trying to get through the day, distracting yourself at any negative emotion you face. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/deeshee-digitopia-is-ruining-our-lives-18d75c9f6b7#5034bde0-038f-4d36-a17c-104d3bba389a)  ^5034bde0

> simplest form of exercise and a good way to reset your brain from all the thoughts flying around. Exercise does some chemistry magic to your body/brain and the dynamic-nature of the “outside world” gives you enough things to look at and process, so that it overrides your negative thoughts.
