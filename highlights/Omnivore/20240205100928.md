## Highlights

> It was meant as an insult, but Crabapple embraced the term. Like many others, she came to self-identify as part of a new generation of Luddites. “Tech is not supposed to be a master tool to colonize every aspect of our being. We need to reevaluate how it serves us.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-luddites-aren-t-backing-down-the-atlantic-18d78be8410#11224e4f-e1d3-42b2-b1f6-e2e0d7e290fc)  ^11224e4f

> The new Luddites—a growing contingent of workers, critics, academics, organizers, and writers—say that too much power has been concentrated in the hands of the tech titans, that tech is too often used to help corporations slash pay and squeeze workers, and that certain technologies must not merely be criticized but resisted outright. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-luddites-aren-t-backing-down-the-atlantic-18d78be8410#a1291126-fac2-425e-aec8-310c0e7b57bc)  ^a1291126

> I [consider myself a Luddite](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/09/18/luddites-social-technology-visionaries/) not because I want to halt progress or reject technology itself. But I believe, as the original Luddites argued in a particularly influential letter threatening the industrialists, that we must consider whether a technology is “hurtful to commonality”—whether it causes many to suffer for the benefit of a few—and oppose it when necessary.

> If they had shared in the gains instead of being left to starve, if they had been given agency over their technological destinies, they would not have taken up their hammers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-luddites-aren-t-backing-down-the-atlantic-18d78be8410#55dddbc3-d996-49ba-986c-42ef4233e0f0)  ^55dddbc3

> To more radically democratize the creation of technologies, in a manner that Silicon Valley pays only lip service to. And if the Luddites continue apace, encouraging more of us to participate, to become Luddites too—to not merely be consumers or users of technology, but shapers—they might not even need the hammers.
