## Highlights

> Wholesale unintentional fabrication is not the same thing as making a flawed argument, or lying, or spinning facts for political gain, and so on. Instead, it’s an error from recombining little bits of text in wrong ways. Turns out for example that an illustrator named Gary Oswalt illustrated a book named _Henrietta Gets a Nest_, and perhaps the statistical reconstruction process got muddled.

> The mechanisms leading to LLM hallucinations just aren’t the same as me forgetting where I put my car keys. Even the errors themselves are qualitatively different. It’s a shame that Hinton doesn’t get that. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/deconstructing-geoffrey-hinton-s-weakest-argument-18d7afeb013#70c4e39e-e299-4171-8e17-7f311e2bcc2f)  ^70c4e39e
