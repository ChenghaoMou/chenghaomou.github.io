## Highlights

> The reason for that feeling, I went on, is that when we read—when we take in any piece of art, actually, in any medium—we’re looking for something more than great content. We are seeking a human connection. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/here-s-the-thing-ai-just-can-t-do-wired-18d8ecaae94#d9402479-343f-4aa0-92d2-ceb7c0beecbb)  ^d9402479

> That epiphany about the meaning of human authorship has been my northern star as I work my way through the challenging AI issues that seem to besiege us every day. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/here-s-the-thing-ai-just-can-t-do-wired-18d8ecaae94#0000781a-167d-41b3-b4fd-aaaea81fa009)  ^0000781a

> Using a ghostwriter invariably distances you from friends and followers who read the caption. Having a _robot_ provide your part of the conversation seems like outsourcing to the extreme. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/here-s-the-thing-ai-just-can-t-do-wired-18d8ecaae94#6f13ce72-5c12-4e99-ba64-25d40ccc4b73)  ^6f13ce72

> No problem hiring someone to walk your dog. But hiring, um, something to _talk_ about your dog? Weird. What if everyone did this? I bet we would not enjoy captions so much. A friend who replied to the automated caption with a comment might feel silly if they later learned that they were responding to something concocted by an artificial neural net, not a squishy biological one. Or maybe, your friend asks _their_ Gemini to come up with a cute reply. Then the humans could sit back while their robots conversed. The repartee might have the rapier wit of a Tom Stoppard play. But there’d be no human connection. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/here-s-the-thing-ai-just-can-t-do-wired-18d8ecaae94#5015d671-dff7-4c35-970e-9e003bc98a86)  ^5015d671

> But some content is contingent on _connection_. Another use case offered in Google’s briefing: “Help me write a document for a job.” Gemini can do terrific things with that. But employers read those things to get a sense of the applicant’s reasoning skills, grasp of the job requirement, and basic sanity. When everyone is generating those letters with AI, those factors will become opaque. Don’t bother with the letter and just send a résumé. For a real connection, the recruiter will have to do the Zoom—and hope you don’t send your deepfake double.
