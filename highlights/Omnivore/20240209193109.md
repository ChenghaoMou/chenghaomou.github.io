## Highlights

> And I think the reason for that is a similar reason as to why the internet sucks so bad now. Work is the default mode of being online today. Work is what we do here, and being here is how we get work. Money, profits, revenue, investors, all of that is why you can’t say “sex” on Tiktok or post a hint of a boob on Instagram.

> A demand for sex built the shopping cart, the browser cookie, ad revenue models, payment processors, and the dynamic web page. The desire to explore and share our sexuality constructed the internet, piece by piece, as we know it today. And then technocratic billionaires betrayed the sexual for the sanitized and safe. We started labeling things “safe for work” and “not safe for work,” a binary that’s telling of who we allowed to call the shots. Sexuality is either unsafe or safe under a pretense of labor, depending on whether a boss is cool with it. Capitalists built walls around the “safe” parts of the internet to appease investors, advertisers, banks, and zealots—and pushed everyone who didn’t comply to the margins.
