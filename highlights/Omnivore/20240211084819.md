> > When you both make yourselves vulnerable from the outset and are candid in revealing who you are and how you think and feel, you create an environment that fosters the kind of openness that can lead to an instant connection — a click.

> It [gives their brain as much pleasure as food or money](http://bakadesuyo.com/2012/05/what-gives-your-brain-as-much-pleasure-as-foo/):
> 
> > Talking about ourselves—whether in a personal conversation or through social media sites like Facebook and Twitter—triggers the same sensation of pleasure in the brain as food or money, researchers reported… “Self-disclosure is extra rewarding,” said Harvard neuroscientist Diana Tamir, who conducted the experiments with Harvard colleague Jason Mitchell. Their findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. **“People were even willing to forgo money in order to talk about themselves,” Ms. Tamir said.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-someone-people-love-to-talk-to-barking-up-the-wrong-tr-18d93cf74e3#2a0580af-29bb-4257-98f1-30804d8bdf6b)  ^2a0580af

> Suspend your ego. Avoid correcting people or saying anything that could be interpreted as one-upmanship. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-someone-people-love-to-talk-to-barking-up-the-wrong-tr-18d93cf74e3#76d88715-faaa-426c-910c-8911e217e51d)  ^76d88715

> 
> > Individuals practicing good ego suspension would continue to encourage the other individual to talk about his or her story, neglecting their own need to share what they think is a great story… Those individuals who allow others to continue talking without taking their own turn are generally regarded as the best conversationalists. These individuals are also sought after when friends or family need someone to listen without judgment. They are the best at building quick and lasting rapport.

> [FBI hostage negotiators](http://bakadesuyo.com/2013/06/hostage-negotiation/) use a number of techniques to show kidnappers they are really paying attention:
> 
> * **Mirroring**: Repeat the last 1-3 words the person just said as a question. (Yes, it’s that simple.)
> * **Paraphrasing**: Repeat what they just said in your own words.
> * **Labeling**: Put a name on what they say they’re feeling. “Sounds like you’re feeling pressured.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-someone-people-love-to-talk-to-barking-up-the-wrong-tr-18d93cf74e3#53770812-ac13-491e-866b-b55127b5d7b6)  ^53770812

> So that’s what to ask about. FBI behavior expert [Robin Dreeke explains](http://bakadesuyo.com/2014/10/how-to-get-people-to-like-you/):
> 
> > A great question I love is challenges. “What kind of challenges did you have at work this week? What kind of challenges do you have living in this part of the country? What kinds of challenges do you have raising teenagers?” Everyone has got challenges. It gets people to share what their priorities in life are at that point in time. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-someone-people-love-to-talk-to-barking-up-the-wrong-tr-18d93cf74e3#2537019c-a161-43bc-ab68-92f027a596db)  ^2537019c

> There’s a [hierarchy of vulnerability](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385529066/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385529066&linkCode=as2&tag=spacforrent-20) in the types of communication we have, each one being more open and more likely to lead to a solid connection:
> 
> * **Phatic**: These statements have no emotional content: _“How are you?”_
> * **Factual**: These share information, maybe personal information, but no strong opinions or emotions are involved: _“I live in New York.”_
> * **Evaluative**: These statements show opinions, but they’re not core beliefs: _“That movie was really funny.”_
> * **Gut-level**: Here’s where it heats up. The first three are thought-oriented. Gut-level communication is emotionally based. It’s personal, says something deeper about who you are and is focused on feelings: _“I’m sad that you’re not here.”_
> * **Peak**: The most emotionally vulnerable level. Peak statements share your innermost feelings. “…feelings that are deeply revealing and carry the most risk in terms how the other person will respond.” These statements are rare, even with people we are very close to: _“I guess at heart I’m terrified I’m going to lose you.”_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-someone-people-love-to-talk-to-barking-up-the-wrong-tr-18d93cf74e3#adb39708-fd19-4ada-a61f-7ca38492d1af)  ^adb39708

> 
> > **Arrangements**: Talk of the Next rings the knell for Now.
> > 
> > **Any statement starting “Finally,” “Lastly”**: Suggests an agenda is nigh complete.
> > 
> > **Satisfied Customer**: A labeling comment to convey a job has been ticked off the list, “Well, I just wanted to check everything was okay.”
> > 
> > **Farewell by implication**: Pre-goodbye goodbyes: passing regards to the wife, etc.
> > 
> > **Past tense**: To kill the Now without committing to future encounters, say “It was great seeing you again,” “This was fun.”
> > 
> > **Time’s winged chariot hurrying near**: That oh-so-pressing world you must be getting on with, or the missus will kill you, or the shops will have run out of Christmas trees, or the kids will be starving…
> > 
> > **Mustn’t keep you**: To suggest that you’re halting the other person’s day is polite… [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-someone-people-love-to-talk-to-barking-up-the-wrong-tr-18d93cf74e3#df9f3201-7264-461b-a601-d353c0efe8c3)  ^df9f3201

> What does FBI behavior expert [Robin Dreeke](http://bakadesuyo.com/2013/11/rapport-building-skills/) say is the best attitude to take when trying to build rapport? **_Make sure the other person walks away better for having met you._** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-someone-people-love-to-talk-to-barking-up-the-wrong-tr-18d93cf74e3#f297c7c7-efc1-40ab-8b56-a13887b69218)  ^f297c7c7

> Stop trying to impress people or “win” the conversation. It’s really much simpler than that.
> 
> Just listen intently and make people feel good about themselves. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-someone-people-love-to-talk-to-barking-up-the-wrong-tr-18d93cf74e3#e5f108d0-0480-4c23-868b-31a05287961e)  ^e5f108d0
