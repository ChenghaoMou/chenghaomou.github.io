## Highlights

> There’s no need to evangelise or make a religion of it: **Working “Agile” boils down to prioritising adaptability over predictability**. We minimise risk by reacting quickly to unforeseen troubles, and we maximise impact by reprioritising based on the opportunities we see. In times when the future is hard to predict, an agile way of working is remarkably efficient.

> Basic Agile is less like executing a plan and more like a process of evolution that drives towards more optimal solutions. However, we can still understand our progress by projecting past work into the future. These projections are like weather forecasts where results are consistent in the short term and get more uncertain as you look further out. Forecasts are much better than estimates because they're based on empirical data instead of guesswork.
