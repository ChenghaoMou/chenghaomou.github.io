## Highlights

> This idea that AI will not impact jobs is ridiculous. First it already has. Google has been replacing jobs for decades, all those print advertising jobs were replaced by online skills, bookshops, retail have all been hit hard by Amazon. We now do research online not in libraries, so they have also taken a hit. Word processors destroyed typing pools, spreadsheets bookkeepers.
