## Highlights

> The most important thing the school taught me, however, was that when you scratch beneath the surface of even the most prestigious people and institutions, you will find reasons not to be intimidated. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/do-not-trust-appearances-my-visit-to-deep-springs-college-18d9e271b01#49785cef-fb02-4b63-817d-80a54bed9c8b)  ^49785cef

> In the end, what Deep Springs College taught me as a visitor in those few days was actually far more valuable than what I might have learned by actually attending the school as a student: Do not be intimidated by, or trust appearances. No one is better than you. Everyone has secrets. Go forward in your life like you belong anywhere you want to be. You can do and be whoever you want to be.   _It is your life._ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/do-not-trust-appearances-my-visit-to-deep-springs-college-18d9e271b01#5fe67d20-77e7-49e7-ba01-d9d547c6595d)  ^5fe67d20
