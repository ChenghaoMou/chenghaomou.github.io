## Highlights

> Being at 0 or 1 on an (normalized) parameter allows you to essentially drop a dimension and build in a degeneracy. Being at 0.534 forces you to model the dimension thoughtfully. I’ve said before that mediocrity is about fatness — reserve resources. Now we can add — it’s also about _fullness_. Full rank. Max dimensionality. No unnecessary reduction to binaries or absolutes. Everything in the nature of the thing is also in the tradeoff space of dealing with the thing. This also means there is something tentative about a mediocre thing. All options are open. None have been foreclosed. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/mediocratopia-13-18daa44836c#ec22a9a1-a21e-4a3a-944c-34c3de3877c0)  ^ec22a9a1
