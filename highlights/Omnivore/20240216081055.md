## Highlights

> I don't know what to do about this, but I have one piece of advice: if you read a book you love, _tell other people_ about it. Tell them face-to-face. In your groupchat. On social media. Even on Goodreads. Every book is a lottery ticket, but the bezzlers are buying their tickets by the case: every time you tell someone about a book you loved (and even better, _why_ you loved it), you buy a writer another ticket.
