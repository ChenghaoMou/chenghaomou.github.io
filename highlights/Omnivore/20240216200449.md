# Sora’s Surreal Physics - by Gary Marcus - Marcus on AI

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/sora-s-surreal-physics-by-gary-marcus-marcus-on-ai-18db2bddf6c)

## Highlights

> One of the most fascinating things Sora’s weird physics glitches is most of these are NOT things that appears in the data. Rather, these glitches are in some ways akin to LLM “hallucinations”, artifacts from (roughly speaking) decompression from lossy compression. They don’t derive from the world.

> More data won’t solve that problem. And like other generative AI systems, there is no way to encode (and guarantee) constraints like “be truthful” or “obey the laws of physics”or “don’t just invent (or eliminate) objects”.

> Sora is fantastic, but it is akin to morphing and splicing, rather than a path to the physical reasoning we would need for AGI. It is a model of how _images_ change over time, not a model of what entities do in the world.
