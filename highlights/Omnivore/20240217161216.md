## Highlights

> “Somewhere between the late 2000’s aggregator sites and the contemporary For You Page, we lost our ability to _curate_ the web. Worse still, we’ve outsourced our discovery to corporate algorithms. Most of us did it in exchange for an endless content feed. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/click-around-find-out-dirty-feed-18db7d6fbee#2de8ed4a-7348-49b0-8336-034b8a37e13a)  ^2de8ed4a

> _Click around._ Or tap around. Or do whatever you need to do in the browser of your choice. If we want the indie web to flourish, the very first thing people need to get used to is _actually browsing the web again_. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/click-around-find-out-dirty-feed-18db7d6fbee#cc809866-1bb3-479c-b6fc-64910b0014e8)  ^cc809866

> If you care about the indie web growing, by all means write, by all means create, by all means curate. But most of all, just _read_. Or _listen_, or _experience_. Spend an afternoon clicking around, like everybody used to. The more people who do that, the more everything else will slot into place without even having to think much about it. If 2024 _truly is_ a tipping point into a new world, then it can’t happen in a vacuum.
