# Sora Can’t Handle the Truth - by Gary Marcus - Marcus on AI

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/sora-can-t-handle-the-truth-by-gary-marcus-marcus-on-ai-18db990477d)

[Read Original](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/sora-cant-handle-the-truth)

## Highlights

> Sora is obviously grounded in relationships between videos and associated texts; yet that grounding is not enough to preclude 7x7 chessboards with 3 kings. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/sora-can-t-handle-the-truth-by-gary-marcus-marcus-on-ai-18db990477d#a40ec942-2522-4f4b-8e2a-cd76bf6c5896)  ^a40ec942

> Rather, Sora is _failing to apprehend a cultural regularity of the world, despite ample evidence_. Some tried to excuse the errors I showed yesterday on the grounds that emulating physics is hard; one can’t say the same for the well-documented rules of chess. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/sora-can-t-handle-the-truth-by-gary-marcus-marcus-on-ai-18db990477d#decfb81e-09f3-4a9f-b5e5-4c19c2d66494)  ^decfb81e

> There, ChatGPT generalized the statistics of English, but without regard to facts. Here, Sora has generalized the visual textures of chess boards, without quite grasping what the proper limits on such generalizations should be. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/sora-can-t-handle-the-truth-by-gary-marcus-marcus-on-ai-18db990477d#1221da08-cf67-42e0-b256-4a843f91f199)  ^1221da08

> The system is trying to approximate the world, but it just isn’t very good at that job. It uses arrangements of pixels to predict other arrangements of pixels, but it does not try to build an internal model of physics, and it does not try to build an internal model of cultural artifacts, either. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/sora-can-t-handle-the-truth-by-gary-marcus-marcus-on-ai-18db990477d#4dce65a2-39e4-44d5-960f-4440e2804dde)  ^4dce65a2

> and the system varies that number freely, as a function of pixels rather than representations of enduring creatures in the world. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/sora-can-t-handle-the-truth-by-gary-marcus-marcus-on-ai-18db990477d#f7be1e22-c604-46f4-9cfd-376104901af3)  ^f7be1e22

> The factuality problems that have haunted LLMs are present even in a new architecture trained on ungodly amounts of data. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/sora-can-t-handle-the-truth-by-gary-marcus-marcus-on-ai-18db990477d#0a5fee39-ff9b-4885-bd7b-78ec8386d073)  ^0a5fee39
