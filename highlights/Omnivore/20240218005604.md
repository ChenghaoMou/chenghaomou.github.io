## Highlights

> Against my well meaning intentions however, websites re-hosting my tools have been popping up like weeds. In some cases, they are even beating me in search results for my own tools. With noted exception, they don't credit me as the author or provide any sort of link back. Many of them have made minor or major modifications to the tools, and next to none provide the source to those modifications. A number of them even have the gall to post links advertising them in the comments of my own tools.

> I didn't think people so lacked in the spirit of open source. I wanted to promote community contributions, not to have them monetized by other people who **don't even provide the source to their modifications**. I wanted to grow the tools as a community, not have closed source forks of them overtake my own open source versions.
