## Highlights

> This seems vicious: repurposing content engenders the proliferation of walled gardens and walled gardens, in turn, engenders the proliferation of repurposed content.)

> Emerging tools like [Perplexity.ai respond to quiries with fulsome answers that do not require users to even click off the site](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/google-search-results-ET4ll7tdT6axzwgifCC3Gw?s=c). In other words, search itself is becoming the delivery of paraphrase and summary. Waning are the days of sifting through “search results” to find a specific source. Henceforth, digital words are little more than raw data to be crunched, processed, and served up by third-party intermediaries. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/what-s-the-fun-in-writing-on-the-internet-anymore-18dbb4c3887#ed0c5d72-bbe9-4c65-9844-b1dacbb608c1)  ^ed0c5d72

> To put any thoughtful labour into crafting words online today is to watch them get sucked up, repurposed, and often monetized by someone else. It feels a bit like a digital wasteland; overrun with pirates, replete with armies of robots regurgitating everything into a gooey cocktail of digital sludge. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/what-s-the-fun-in-writing-on-the-internet-anymore-18dbb4c3887#ed585e9c-5b5c-4ba3-b309-fd4c699284f7)  ^ed585e9c

> Write here because _ideas_ matter, not authorship. Write here because the more robots, pirates, and single-minded trolls swallow up cyberspace, the more we need independent writing in order to think new thoughts in the future — even if your words are getting dished up and plated by an algorithm. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/what-s-the-fun-in-writing-on-the-internet-anymore-18dbb4c3887#c0ab1e4b-8936-4a05-a292-af478dba580a)  ^c0ab1e4b

> Those who _write_ — those who add ideas instead of paraphrasing and regurgitating them — inform the lexicology and mental corpus of how we think in the future. Indeed, the point isn’t “being an author,” but contributing one’s perspective, even if one’s personal identity is silenced, erased, and anonymized along the way.
