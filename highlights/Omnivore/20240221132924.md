## Highlights

> "And that's indeed what we found," Ma said. "We found RTO mandates are more common among male CEOs and more powerful CEOs. So that's consistent with these managers using RTO mandates to reassert control."

> He added: "It is my personal belief that, as prior research suggests, most CEOs are very narcissistic. That means they are used to being in the center of everything and issuing orders for employees to follow. But after the pandemic, they feel kind of like they're losing power because employees became more and more aware of their rights during the great resignation. So, the managers feel that they are losing their power inside the firm, basically, and as a result, they want to grab their power back in this relationship. And that's the reason we found such results."
