## Highlights

> **The majority of censorship is self-censorship, but the majority of self-censorship is intentionally cultivated by an outside power**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/tools-for-thinking-about-censorship-reactor-18dd0d9d4e6#35bffdbd-6959-4565-975e-e7666adaff31)  ^35bffdbd

> Fear is one of the two main ways powers cultivate self-censorship and middleman censorship, but its partner is _projection of power_, which is not quite the same. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/tools-for-thinking-about-censorship-reactor-18dd0d9d4e6#99823c47-9330-4369-a0eb-a93682b25fc7)  ^99823c47

> Rather they target a few people unpredictably and conspicuously, so that everyone else in a similar situation will feel fear, and self-censor or middleman-censor more, including self-censoring in arenas unrelated to what was targeted (i.e. someone who both owns porn and supports a political resistance party might become more afraid to support that party after a widely-publicized crackdown on someone who owned porn, or vice versa). This is an extremely potent and cost-effective tactic, and a go-to for many regimes, from Imperial Rome, to enforcement of anti-sedition laws in WWI and WWII, to today’s anime/manga censorship, etc. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/tools-for-thinking-about-censorship-reactor-18dd0d9d4e6#db9245e8-31d0-42d0-b461-dda8642ea365)  ^db9245e8

> For this reason, we _cannot_ consider state and non-state censorship separate things. State censorship systems work dominantly via shaping and causing private censorship.
