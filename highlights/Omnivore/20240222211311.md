## Highlights

> The way sites like TikTok and YouTube give you a feed of content means you can consume it in an unbroken fashion. It reminds me of the people you see at slot machines in casinos, pulling the lever to see what will happen. Maybe you'll get lucky and come across something awesome.
> 
> The content also keeps you in a kind of trance - a state where you don't _have_ to think if you don't want to. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/you-tube-addiction-one-month-sober-18dd28249e2#67365e8a-8a27-4eb2-88ac-5eac4f7da3b9)  ^67365e8a

> Addiction is isolating. The particular addiction, YouTube, is a lot of wanting to connect to others in a very safe way. So, to combat this, the goal is to "reach out". To connect to real people. To get my 'cup' filled with real intimacy and connections with others. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/you-tube-addiction-one-month-sober-18dd28249e2#dd2c5a21-da23-4d00-b2af-8d37b7f3f991)  ^dd2c5a21
