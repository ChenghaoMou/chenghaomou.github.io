## Highlights

> The [idea](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/) is that you tie your expensively-trained, confabulation prone LLM that you can’t afford to update frequently to other sources of information such a more regularly and cheaply updated databases or company doceuments. And somehow RAG will solve all your problems. If your LLM has been trained on so-and-so being the Senator X from New Giant State and there is an election in New Giant State and Senator Y replaces Senator X, you want to be able quickly fix any relevant queries immediately without retraining

> Reality is that RAG is still in its infancy, a work in progress much as LLMs themselves are, an no more guaranteed to be correct. Like LLMs, RAG can appear spectacular at times, but there is no evidence that it is a cure-all. As one recent review from December puts it “[there is still a considerable journey ahead to effectively apply RAG to LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07483).” In the words of another, from earlier this month, “[While building an initial RAG application is easy, making it robust is non-trivial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07483).”
