## Highlights

> The authors thus provide another human baseline: The first author Garrett Tanzer learned how to translate Kalamang from scratch by reading the grammar book for 10+ hours and then used the parallel data and the Internet as reference when performing the translation task over the course of several weeks. _That_ is dedication to human evaluation!

> However, the embodied, interactive, and multi-modal nature of [first language (L1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%5Flanguage) acquisition is challenging to replicate with current models. L2 acquisition in the form of true zero-shot MT may be a more accessible testbed to study how a model learns a new language based on limited linguistic resources.

> To make most use of such resources, both in obtaining and understanding the data as well as interpreting model results requires collaborating with linguists. MTOB provides an example of how such a collaboration can look like in practice, with the linguist actively participating in the research and co-authoring the paper. Such inter-disciplinary collaborations, while challenging and complex, are often a breath of fresh air—so I hope to see more of them in the future.
