## Highlights

> SenLiYu [wrote about the book binding issue](https://twitter.com/SenLinYuWrites/status/1761866371254906952?ref=404media.co) on Twitter: “As someone not planning to delete all their fanworks, can I just say, there is a vast mental/emotional toll to having your creative work ceaselessly exploited. Especially when it happens in a manner adjacent to a community that you consider yourself a part of,” she wrote. “Fandom is about community more than it's about any specific original work, that's why a community can migrate light years away from the OG and become a new microcosmic space. It's the people and relationships, the journeys of writers, artists, and readers that makes it meaningful.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fanfiction-community-rocked-by-etsy-sellers-turning-their-work-i-18df11e8d13#cd5f66b7-e613-45b5-9ad7-26d0dba0fdb0)  ^cd5f66b7
