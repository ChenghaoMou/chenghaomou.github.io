## Highlights

> Opt-out is “our lawyers told us to make this an option to cover our ass, but we don’t want you to actually do it”.
> 
> Opt-out is “if you missed the memo, we assume we have your consent”.
> 
> The default state of any decision regarding user data should be opted out. Users should instead be required to opt in for your decision to take effect, and they must not be coerced into doing so.
> 
> If consent is not explicitly given by an informed user, you haven’t received consent at all, and to pretend otherwise is unethical.
> 
> Your users don’t fucking care about opt-out. We care about opt-in. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-tech-industry-doesn-t-understand-consent-dhole-moments-18df127b9bd#706d4297-6bb4-4ab6-a651-d4fe3984adf6)  ^706d4297
