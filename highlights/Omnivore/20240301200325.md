## Highlights

> Gemini speaks in the familiar, unmistakable voice of institutional caution and self-interest. It’s a piece of software mimicking a person whose job is to speak for a corporation. It has an impossible job, not because it’s hard but because it’s internally ill defined, externally contested, and kind of stupid. It was doomed from the start, in other words. All chatbots are.

> it is exceedingly difficult for Gemini to talk or act like a real person. And as with other elite, powerful institutions, the gaps between how Google talks about itself and how people understand it are large and fertile spaces for criticism.

> In his [mea culpa/disciplinary](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/27/2024/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-calls-ai-tools-responses-completely-unacceptable) letter to staff about Gemini, Pichai wrote:

We’ve always sought to give users helpful, accurate, and unbiased information in our products. That’s why people trust them. This has to be our approach for all our products, including our emerging AI products.

Google’s actual mission has long been to deliver value to shareholders by selling advertising, much of it through a search engine, which is obviously and demonstrably biased, not just by the content it crawls and searches through but in the intentional, [commercially motivated](https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results) manner in which Google presents it.

> Most of the time, Google can shrug its shoulders, gesture at “the web,” and claim to be doing its best; social networks can shrug their shoulders, gesture at their users, and say they’re looking into the matter.

> Google has spent the past 20 years insisting its systems merely provide access to information, minimizing its role on the internet and in the world when strategically convenient. With Gemini, incredibly, Google assigned itself a _literal voice_, spoken by a leader-employee-assistant-naïf character pulled in so many different directions that it doesn’t act like a human at all and whose core competency is generating infinite grievances in users who were already skeptical of the company, if not outright hostile to it.

> Instead, a chatbot for everyone and everything is destined to become a chatbot for nobody and nothing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/chat-gpt-and-google-gemini-are-both-doomed-18dfb9d4627#5e329231-3bce-49ee-9f58-eec228ecc191)  ^5e329231
