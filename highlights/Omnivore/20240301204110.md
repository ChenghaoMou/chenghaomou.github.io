## Highlights

> The large-scale selling of user posts to third parties is not unique to Automattic, nor is it even really possible to track what they are being used for, but the practice reveals a complicated ecosystem of data sales to third parties for a variety of reasons that highlights the business models of so many large platforms. We know from covering data brokers in other industries for years that it is often difficult for the original company sharing the data to track specifically how it is used further down the supply chain. It can also be difficult to enforce against misuse; cutting off future data access, for example, doesn’t always mean that a bad actor is going to delete the data they’ve already gotten.

> Given this complicated and ever-changing supply chain, even if you read the terms of service agreements back when you started posting to Tumblr and Wordpress more than a decade ago, there was no way for you to know that that content would eventually be used by companies building AI tools that are actively working to replace the same type of human labor that created that content.
