## Highlights

> Karen Brinson Bell, a Democrat and executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, who participated in the rating, said that before the testing session, she’d been worried about AI being used to deliberately create false information. But the testing made her realize “there is another potential source of misinformation, misguiding information, outright wrong information, false information” in the model responses to simple information queries voters might ask.

> But the AI Democracy Projects’ testing surfaced another type of harm: the steady erosion of the truth by hundreds of small mistakes, falsehoods, and misconceptions presented as “artificial intelligence” rather than plausible-sounding, unverified guesses.

> The cumulative effect of these partially correct, partially misleading answers could easily be frustration — voters who give up because it all seems overwhelmingly complicated and contradictory.
