## Highlights

> A separate study from a university in the Netherlands, this one peer-reviewed, [found](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/climate/ai-could-soon-need-as-much-electricity-as-an-entire-country.html) that AI servers’ electricity demand could grow, over the same period, to be on the order of 100 terawatt hours per year, [about as much](https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world/electricity/electricity-consumption?pd=2&p=0000002&u=0&f=A&v=mapbubble&a=-&i=none&vo=value&&t=C&g=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001&l=249-ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1vrvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvvnvvvs0008&s=315532800000&e=1609459200000) as the entire annual consumption of Argentina or Sweden. [Microsoft’s own environmental reports](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW13PLE) show that, during the initial uptick in the AI platform’s growth, the company’s resource consumption was accelerating. In fiscal year 2022, the most recent year for which Microsoft has released data, the tech giant’s use of water and electricity grew by about a third; in absolute terms, it was the company’s largest-ever reported increase, year to year.
