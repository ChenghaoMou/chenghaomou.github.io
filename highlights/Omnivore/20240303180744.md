## Highlights

> But in AI, the incumbents already have the innovation (whether through closed APIs or open source), while startups struggle as mightily as ever to find distribution. Perhaps an even greater struggle, as every market is over-saturated with new startup competitors, some with massive funding. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/ai-startups-require-new-strategies-this-time-it-s-actually-diffe-18e05801633#26ed298f-1a1e-4717-ae65-0426810c03cc)  ^26ed298f

> “There’s no AI strategy without a data strategy,” the (now often-repeated) saying goes. For training, testing, benchmarking, and features, you need data. Incumbents have it or can afford it; startups are at another disadvantage.

> AI will continue to become cheaper, better, and faster in the next few years. Getting access to huge amounts of training data will not; in fact, just the opposite as the companies who possess that data have already learned how valuable it is.
