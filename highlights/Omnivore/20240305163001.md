## Highlights

> Auto manufacturers are obliged to recall their cars when they produce serious problems. What Hofman and his collaborators (including the MacArthur Fellow Dan Jurafsky) have documented may already be having real-world impact. In many ways, we have no idea how LLMs actually get used in the real world, e.g. how they get used in housing decisions, loan decisions, crime proceedings etc – but now strong evidence to suspect covert racism to the extent that it is used in such use cases.
