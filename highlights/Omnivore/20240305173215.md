## Highlights

> This is all to say that some version of AI has infiltrated nearly every video editing program, and, the threat from these tools, and the strategy that Mustafa and other influencers are promoting is that the internet and every platform on it will be increasingly filled with AI-generated and assisted content, even if it’s not what people actually want. The strategy that _actually_ has been working, based on what I’ve seen in the Discord, is simply stealing other people’s high-quality content and making it appear as though you are doing high-quality work yourself. For a while, I was seeing tons of AI-generated TikToks on my feed, but feel like I’ve been seeing fewer and fewer of the types of low-quality TikToks I was able to make using the tools and automation resources I found in the Discord.
