## Highlights

> Gemini’s Palestine results once again betray one of the biggest predicaments that technology companies currently developing generative AI tools face: the results we see from generative AI tools are influenced by the decisions of their creators and the data that powers them, despite any attempt at objectivity or impartiality. AI tool makers reveal their point of view, and often reinforce existing biases in our culture because its present in the data they train on, whether they limit or control the output to produce certain results, as is the case with Gemini and the Palestine question, or if they release “[uncensored](https://www.404media.co/260-million-ai-company-releases-chatbot-that-gives-detailed-instructions-on-murder-ethnic-cleansing/)” AI tools, which can easily produce dangerous answers, which itself is a political and ethical position.
