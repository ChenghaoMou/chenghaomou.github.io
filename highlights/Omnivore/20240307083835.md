# OpenAI’s “Own Goal” - by Gary Marcus - Marcus on AI

## Highlights

> Rather than sharing with everyone, they are mostly sharing with Microsoft, which has an exclusive right to some aspects of the software and models. And 49% of OpenAI’s first couple hundred billion dollars in profits goes to them. Rather than helping all humanity OpenAI is (I would argue) effectively stealing intellectual property from artists, writers, etc to increase their profits.

> But seen from another perspective, releasing that email was a massive fuckup—because it shows decisively that OpenAI knew for _years_  that they had no intention of being as open as their name or public statements suggested.

> They _knew_ they were misleading people and failed to take an opportunity to correct. Very reminiscent of when Sam Altman told the Senate in May 2023 that he had no direct equity in OpenAI when he could clarified that he did have indirect equity.

> Positive efforts “to use AI to improve people’s lives and unlock a better future” would be nice. But casting a blind eye to covert racism, apparent copyright infringement, and violent and degrading outputs is not.
