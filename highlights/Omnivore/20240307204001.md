## Highlights

> Adding about a minute of silence to the start of the recording bypassed ElevenLabs’ safeguards to instantly create voice clones of Biden, Donald Trump, Taylor Swift, and Gavin Newsom. 
> 
> The news shows yet another example of how companies that produce generative AI tools that anyone can access online still struggle to moderate these tools and prevent them from producing harmful content.

> But whatever method ElevenLabs is using to block specific voice clones is obviously far from perfect. In addition to allowing me to generate a Biden voice clone, who you’d think would be the one voice ElevenLabs would want to block the most given the New Hampshire robocall incident, ElevenLabs also allowed me to clone the voice of California Governor Gavin Newsom and Swift by adding a bit of silence to the start of the recording.
