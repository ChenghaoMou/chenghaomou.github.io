## Highlights

> Facebook didn’t adopt Mercurial because it was more performant than Git. They adopted it because the maintainers and codebase felt more open to collaboration. Facebook engineers met face-to-face with Mercurial maintainers and liked the idea of partnering. When it came to persuading the whole engineering org, the decision got buy-in due to thoughtful communication - not because one technology was strictly better than another.

> Kindness and openness go far in the world of devtools, and I aim to carry on these values as I contribute to the history of source control. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-facebook-doesn-t-use-git-18e1d2d453c#388c7847-0f43-40cd-84b6-d16bc1090e99)  ^388c7847
