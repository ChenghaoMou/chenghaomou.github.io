## Highlights

> Germanus directed this second comment to Abba Serenus of Scetis, who responded, “The _nous_ or mind is defined as _aeikinētos kai polykinētos_, always and very much on the move.” You might recognize our word _kinetic_ in the Greek. This bubbling, jumping, flitting mind can only be tamed by training through meditation, memorization, fasting, and other forms of ascetical effort by which “it will become strong enough to drive off the enemy’s stimuli. . . .”
> 
> It’s a bit of a relief to realize, no? Why does the mind meander? Because that’s what minds do. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/what-monks-know-about-focus-by-joel-j-miller-18e2584b0fc#11cc9104-cf00-437f-a8a6-872acaa71f48)  ^11cc9104

> A book is a tool. It’s a machine for thinking. And “all machines,” as Thoreau once said, “have their friction.” The time it takes to engage with ideas—whether factual or fictional, emotional or intellectual, accurate or inaccurate, efficient or inefficient—might strike some as a drag. But the time given to working through those ideas, adopting and adapting, developing or discarding, changes our minds, changes us.
> 
> It’s not about the wisdom we glean. It’s about what wisdom we grow. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/what-monks-know-about-focus-by-joel-j-miller-18e2584b0fc#d3032607-19f8-4c14-b64c-efe4974a9e65)  ^d3032607
