## Highlights

> Our brain is [single-thread](https://calnewport.com/our-brains-are-not-multi-threaded/ "single-threaded")ed, context switching is an expensive process and it can only keep much information, the point of getting information is to use it and not just store it. Because that’s what your machine is doing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/read-it-never-recur-think-18e2ace3439#ef2e2ca8-6dc8-42e3-9238-4a2435231585)  ^ef2e2ca8

> So, relax, there will always be new things, and you will never be able to learn everything. If you find something interesting now, and you have time to read it, do it now! (it might not be interesting tomorrow) When you read it, understand it properly as you are using your mental effort.
