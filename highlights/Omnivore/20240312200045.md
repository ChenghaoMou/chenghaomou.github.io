## Highlights

> Safety depends to a large extent on the context and the environment in which the AI model or AI system is deployed. We have to specify a particular context before we can even meaningfully ask an AI safety question. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/ai-safety-is-not-a-model-property-18e3440cbd4#46536cfd-b4eb-4f9b-9674-fbfca31b799d)  ^46536cfd

> In short, trying to make an AI model that can’t be misused is like trying to make a computer that can’t be used for bad things. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/ai-safety-is-not-a-model-property-18e3440cbd4#04aa0477-1f67-4e10-bfdc-e61dbaa35f38)  ^04aa0477

> Here again the model lacks the context to prevent only “bad” uses: it doesn’t know whether the task it is asked to perform is part of the user’s homework. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/ai-safety-is-not-a-model-property-18e3440cbd4#cb7bb102-631d-46fd-9c60-fff74298c5bb)  ^cb7bb102
