## Highlights

> However, Google's memo fails to mention that it already has the infrastructure to run computing-hungry AI models and that infrastructure is wildly expensive to build. That's why four companies own most of it. The real moat is the fields of data centers, specialized GPUs, and hundreds of miles of deep-sea fiber optic cables.

> He’s made these moves because raw computing power _is the business model_. So, who gives a shit if Meta put Llama on Github for free? How will anyone ship their resulting AI-featured app without Meta’s cloud infrastructure? _Read the terms and conditions_. [Llama is not open-source](https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-source-llm-not-open).

> Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta already control so much of what we see and don’t see. If they can suppress an active genocide on the platform layer, imagine what they can do when they control the whole kit and kaboodle.

> So, if we want a true indie web, we must be prepared to fight for it. Hope is not enough. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/any-technology-indistinguishable-from-magic-is-hiding-something-18e369b9eb9#e6068662-78a1-487c-bd6f-7f325ec458ee)  ^e6068662
