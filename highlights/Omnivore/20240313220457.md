## Highlights

> Filipino contractors’ wages and work hours were determined by their jobs: On average, contractors earned about $2.00 per hour and worked about 30 hours per week. While AllDone paid its Filipino workers only a tiny fraction of what San Francisco–based employees earned, their compensation substantially exceeded the Philippines’ legal minimum wage. As independent contractors, these workers didn’t receive paid vacation, sick leave, health insurance, or retirement benefits, nor did they enjoy the perks (like free food) available to workers in the San Francisco office. Contractors were also responsible for providing their own computer equipment and Internet connections.
> 
>  Contractors effectively functioned as _artificial_[artificial intelligence](https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/), simulating the output of software algorithms that had yet to be completed.
> 
>  Companies seeking workers to do routine information processing often post tasks to on-demand “crowdwork” platforms like [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/). In AllDone’s case, the importance of its contractors’ tasks to the company’s success meant that an open call fulfilled by anonymous workers simply wouldn’t do. AllDone’s staff in San Francisco considered AllDone Philippines an integral part of the organization and built enduring relationships with contractors, who typically performed the same assigned task for a period of months or even years. Newly hired contractors watched training videos to learn how to perform operations using AllDone’s proprietary administrative software. Managers of the Filipino divisions distributed weekly quizzes and offered coaching to ensure that workers understood AllDone’s rules and procedures.

> The Filipinos’ reliable performance of important tasks helped the company achieve the precipitous growth demanded by venture capital investors to rapidly increase the company’s valuation. While the team in San Francisco threw parties for new recruits, enjoyed catered meals, and created the impression of technological wizardry, Filipino contractors were toiling behind the scenes.

> AllDone’s story highlights the unseen but ongoing role of human workers on the frontiers of automation, and it demonstrates why it’s too soon to forecast a future of full automation or a world without work. The interdependence between generously compensated software engineers in San Francisco and low-cost contractors in the Philippines suggests that advances in software automation still rely not only on human labor, but also on global inequalities.
