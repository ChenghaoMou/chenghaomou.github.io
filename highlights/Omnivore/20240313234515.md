## Highlights

> Computer-generated movies may get technically perfect. Maybe, one day, the FBI can’t tell the difference between Sora and Stanley Kubrick. But as soon as we’d know, the emptiness of its reality would suck us right back into its black hole. Just like computer chess. _Why should I care on this side when no one cares on the other side?_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/ai-videos-psychotic-18e3a34b25c#ee58cdb0-063c-4b11-a0ad-0eab92d17d50)  ^ee58cdb0

> What ultimately creeps us out is that all of this happens without any intended sense or meaning. It seems psychotic. _AI acts like a psychotic liar that constantly changes the story for no apparent reason._ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/ai-videos-psychotic-18e3a34b25c#a6a1fbd7-71af-491b-a9d0-b53e3fe1310c)  ^a6a1fbd7
