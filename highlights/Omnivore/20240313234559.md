## Highlights

> On the contrary, using AI you need to think harder, deeper, clearer. You have more time now, so use it to do what the machine cannot. Use them reasonably. Know what you say. Question your understanding. Use AI as a workout to make sure that what you say is what you know and mean to say. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/ai-and-the-end-of-writing-18e3a355e2a#ea385300-bc3c-4895-aed5-d6cd2dcc5061)  ^ea385300

> We need to rethink ourselves—and we need to observe AI. And we need to observe it now, as it still makes obvious mistakes and reveals through its bugs how it works. Once it simulates us perfectly, we won’t understand it at all anymore. We won’t be able to discern it from us and understand how it works. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/ai-and-the-end-of-writing-18e3a355e2a#2fd2643b-1d30-4e9f-bb00-2f59a2ac3b20)  ^2fd2643b

> Still, there is hope. The hope is that through the right use of machines, we learn to be different from them. If you use AI mindfully, not to fool others but to question yourself, to think deeper and to better control your self-expression instead of automating it, there is a chance that you will understand more and not less.

> There is a chance that AI can become a gym for your mind. If you have used AI yourself, you have learned that the output of AI improves the more you understand what you are doing. This is perfectly clear with image generation, but it’s the same when it comes to text and coding. Only if you know what you want and understand what you are doing, can you use your tools appropriately to achieve the results you desire.

> The end of writing is to understand each other through time and space, to feel what others have felt and to make others feel through time and space how we feel now. AI can mess this up, badly, by blurring what was written by humans and what was generated without feeling or understanding—but it cannot end it.
