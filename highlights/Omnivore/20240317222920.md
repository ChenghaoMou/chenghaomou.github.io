## Highlights

> You don’t need a degree in finance to understand this. All you need is a good metaphor, and here it is: the units in your bank account - which you use when you are paying digitally via app or card - are not government money. They are **digital casino chips** **issued out by banks.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-luddite-s-guide-to-defending-cash-part-1-18e4e88a019#733fdb2d-3b3e-409a-adb9-59a742ea7638)  ^733fdb2d

> Digital money is not an ‘upgrade’ to cash, because it derives its own power from cash. If you don’t believe that, watch what happens every time the banking sector looks shaky, or a crisis looms: cash withdrawals spike. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-luddite-s-guide-to-defending-cash-part-1-18e4e88a019#d56c1030-2e09-4477-b1ff-84dde96be2d0)  ^d56c1030

> The reason people answer like this is that they wish for _choice_. The digital payments industry, by contrast, would prefer a lack of choice. They’d benefit if we became completely dependent on their systems, but if that actually happens, the balance of power between between autonomy and dependence, and public and private, would be radically shifted.
