> **But of course, this is not what companies want. You don’t want to be tracked, but they want to track you.**
> 
> So they force half-page-size banners on you, grey out the content and prevent you reading their site, in the hope you say yes. Or you are worn down and no longer care after twenty banners and say yes. Or you misclick and say yes. Or you are confused and say accidentally yes. Or they nudge you with Dark UI Patterns into saying yes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/there-is-no-cookie-banner-law-18e51d64a0e#97562142-d244-4fc7-adef-20376c1ab1fa)  ^97562142

> _“Companies are making your life hard by choice. They got told by the EU they could not be secret abusers anymore, so now they decided to be irritating on top.”_ 
> 
> It’s like a child throwing a tantrum _“But I want the toy!”_.
>

>
