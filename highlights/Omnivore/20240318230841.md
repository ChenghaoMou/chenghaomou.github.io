# Have We Reached Peak AI?

## Highlights

> This is the problem with powerful people in tech. If you allow them to speak and fill in the gaps for them, they will happily do so. Murati and Altman continuously obfuscate how ChatGPT works, what it can do, what it _could_ do, and profit handsomely from a complete lack of pushback from a press that routinely accepts AI executives' vague explanations at face value. OpenAI's messaging and explanations of what its technology can (or will) do have barely changed in the last few years, returning repeatedly to "eventually" and "in the future" and speaking in the vaguest ways about how businesses make money off of — let alone _profit_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/have-we-reached-peak-ai-18e53d30145#4599b058-7d91-4f54-975b-33f30ab850de) ^4599b058

> I believe a large part of the artificial intelligence boom is hot air, pumped through a combination of executive bullshitting and a compliant media that will gladly write stories _imagining_ what AI can do rather than focus on what it's actually doing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/have-we-reached-peak-ai-18e53d30145#da44999c-2e4c-47e3-a263-e1600caea8c5) ^da44999c

> Every single time I've read about the "amazing" things that artificial intelligence can do, I see somebody attempting to add fuel to a fire that's close to going out. While Joanna Stern may have said that Sora's generative video clips "[freaked her out](https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/openai-cto-sora-generative-video-interview-b66320bb?ref=wheresyoured.at)," much of what makes them scary is the assumption that OpenAI will fix hallucinations, something that the company has categorically failed to do. AI hype is predicated on solving problems with AI models that are only getting worse, and OpenAI's only answers are a combination of "we'll work it out eventually, trust me" and "we need a technological breakthrough in [chips](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0?ref=wheresyoured.at) and [energy](https://www.popsci.com/technology/sam-altman-age-of-ai-will-require-an-energy-breakthrough/?ref=wheresyoured.at)." [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/have-we-reached-peak-ai-18e53d30145#87106044-8f9d-40e8-8da3-f824554ddc95) ^87106044

> [As I've written before](https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-fried/), hallucinations are a feature not a bug. These models do not "know" anything. They are mathematical behemoths generating a best guess based on training data and labeling, and thus do not "know" what you are asking it to do. You simply cannot fix them. Hallucinations are not going away. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/have-we-reached-peak-ai-18e53d30145#deb76875-5779-4784-ae27-24c531a7a80a) ^deb76875

> Murati's mealy-mouthed answers around "publicly-available data" heavily suggest that OpenAI's models are trained on YouTube and Facebook videos, meaning that any public launch of Sora will be one that's immediately met with an apocalyptic legal fight. How apocalyptic? Well, [a study from last week](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/gpt-4-researchers-tested-leading-ai-models-for-copyright-infringement.html?ref=wheresyoured.at) revealed that every single model produced copyrighted material, with OpenAI's GPT-4 producing it on 44% of the prompts constructed for the study, and[ Nvidia is being sued by authors claiming its NeMo language model violates their copyright](https://www.engadget.com/now-its-nvidia-being-sued-over-ai-copyright-infringement-083407300.html?ref=wheresyoured.at) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/have-we-reached-peak-ai-18e53d30145#30885e10-07da-4521-8804-3b6e64a730ca) ^30885e10

> If you focus on the present — what OpenAI's technology can do today, and will likely do for some time — you see in terrifying clarity that generative AI isn't a society-altering technology, but another form of efficiency-driving cloud computing software that benefits a relatively small niche of people.
