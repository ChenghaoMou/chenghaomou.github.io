## Highlights

> _However_, it remains the case that OpenAI is allowing tools on the GPT Store that promote academically dishonest behavior — even if the behavior doesn’t have the intended outcome.
>
> The OpenAI spokesperson said:
>
> > GPTs that are for academic dishonesty, including cheating, are against our policy. This would include GPTs that are stated to be for circumventing academic integrity tools like plagiarism detectors. We see some GPTs that are for ‘humanizing’ text. We’re still learning from the real world use of these GPTs, but we understand there are many reasons why users might prefer to have AI-generated content that doesn’t ‘sound’ like AI.

> But the GPT Store is running into the teething problems many of the largest-scale app, product and service digital marketplaces did in their early days. Beyond spam, a recent [report](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-chatbot-app-store-is-off-to-a-slow-start) in The Information revealed that GPT Store developers are struggling to attract users in part because of the GPT Store’s limited back-end analytics and subpar onboarding experience.

> One might’ve assumed OpenAI — for all its talk of curation and the importance of safeguards — would’ve taken pains to avoid the obvious pitfalls. But that doesn’t appear to be the case. The GPT Store is a mess — and, if something doesn’t change soon, it may well stay that way. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/tech-crunch-18e5debf34d#fb77da03-00d1-4129-902c-57fc9d21c959)  ^fb77da03
