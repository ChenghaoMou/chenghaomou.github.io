## Highlights

> And this is why I'm so taken by the Willy Wonka story. It's got it all: AI-generated garbage marketing, [scripts](https://gizmodo.com/heres-the-full-ai-generated-script-from-the-willy-wonka-1851295448) that make absolutely no sense (produced by text-extruding machines), copyright infringement and questionable trademark practices ("Willy Wonka" is never used in their copy anywhere, and the narrator is named _Willy McDuff_, which sounds like a Simpsons-inspired MacBeth-killer), [exploited workers](https://gizmodo.com/actor-from-willy-wonka-fiasco-says-ai-generated-script-1851293866) not knowing what they were getting into, and, of course, frustrated and crying children with their livid parents. The "House of Illuminati", the show's producers, really encapsulated all the shittiness of our AI-generated future in one single, dreary warehouse in the UK. The scam may have happened without all the sunshine and rainbows present in the marketing copy, or without the 15-page script that was summarily abandoned. But that's also not the issue. Cheap bots ensure that this is won't be our last Willy Chocolate Experience.
