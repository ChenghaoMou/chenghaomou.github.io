## Highlights

> I asked Rao if any of the DBRX training data sets were copyrighted or licensed, or show obvious signs of biases (e.g. [racial biases](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/anthropics-latest-tactic-to-stop-racist-ai-asking-it-really-really-really-really-nicely/)), but he didn’t answer directly, saying only, “We’ve been careful about the data used, and conducted red teaming exercises to improve the model’s weaknesses.” Generative AI models have a tendency to [regurgitate](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/image-generating-ai-can-copy-and-paste-from-training-data-raising-ip-concerns/) training data, an major concern for commercial users of models trained on unlicensed, copyrighted or very clearly biased data. In the worst-case scenario, a user could end up on the ethical and legal hooks for unwittingly incorporating IP-infringing or biased work from a model into their projects.
