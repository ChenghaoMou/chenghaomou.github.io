## Highlights

> It is a recipe for disaffection and rage. When young people see that society takes no stake in them, it’s a small step for them to reject any stake in society. A few candidates will know people who know people, but many parents don’t know how to help their children, so profoundly has the world of work changed since their first jobs. Watching this automated misery, they feel humiliated too.

> Kids will remember who helped and who treated them as disposable. No amount of advertising will persuade them that the companies that never replied will ever care, about people or the planet or customers.

> Those who unthinkingly embrace technology in recruitment are wilfully blind to its consequences. Across the board we have generations of eager, able young people struggling to pay the bills and make their contribution. We should be thinking now about how to preserve social cohesion, if only for the simple reason that, without it, no business will flourish.
