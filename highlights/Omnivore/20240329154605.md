## Highlights

> And it leads to my second point, about (in)justice: I am increasingly worried that the big tech companies are—in conjunction with a Congress that has not yet passed any substantive AI legislation—successfully architecting a grossly asymmetric world, in which the profits from the positive side flow to them, and the costs of the negative side are borne by everyone else.

> Where we are is this: Artists and creators, and now influencers, are having their careers wrecked by software that trades on their work; in many cases, the companies training their models on these works are not paying for that work. (OpenAI even brazenly asked the British goverment to exempt them from copyright laws, wanting all the gain at none of the cost.) Meanwhile, the companies are also not being held legally responsible for the damage that generative AI is causing to society.
