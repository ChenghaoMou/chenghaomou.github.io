## Highlights

> "Botshit" was coined last December, but the internet is already drowning in it. Desperate people, confronted with an economy modeled on a high-speed game of musical chairs in which the opportunities for a decent livelihood grow ever scarcer, are being scammed into generating _mountains_ of botshit in the hopes of securing the elusive "passive income": [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-pluralistic-net-2024-03-14-inhuman-centipede-18e3f95b9df#8fce85b3-5c1e-4e42-bdc4-dc3bcee6e809)  ^8fce85b3

> The question is, why the _fuck_ would anyone write the web if the only "person" who can find what they write is an AI's crawler, which ingests the writing for its own training, but has no interest in steering readers to see what you've written? If AI search ever becomes a thing, the open web will become an AI CAFO and search crawlers will increasingly end up imbibing the contents of its manure lagoon.

> What's more, while the proposition that "more training data will linearly improve the quality of AI predictions" is a mere article of faith, "training an AI on the output of another AI makes it _exponentially worse_" is a matter of _fact_.
