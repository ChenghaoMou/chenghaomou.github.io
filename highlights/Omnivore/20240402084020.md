## Highlights

> Open models democratize access to AI technology, enabling use cases that are financially unviable with closed models (e.g. a local high school could purchase a single computer to give students unlimited access to an open LLM, but would need to pay perpetual fees to a closed model provider like OpenAI). Open models allow academics and startups to build and distribute new applications, undreamt of by the creators of foundation models. Open models can be easily built into existing workflows and applications (see e.g. community-built integrations for Stable Diffusion in [Photoshop](https://github.com/AbdullahAlfaraj/Auto-Photoshop-StableDiffusion-Plugin) and [Blender](https://github.com/benrugg/AI-Render), while DALL-E remains mostly walled off).

> In general, there are two approaches to social harm: we can disincentivize it through punishment, or we can try to eradicate it through surveillance and control. The former is the norm in free societies, while the latter is a hallmark of oppression.
