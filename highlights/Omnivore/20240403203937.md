# Meta’s AI image generator can’t imagine an Asian man with a white woman - The Verge

## Highlights

> The image generator also didn’t like when I asked for representations of platonic relationships, like “Asian man with Caucasian friend” and “Asian woman and white friend.” Each time, it returned images of two Asian people. When I asked for a picture of an “Asian woman with Black friend,” the AI-generated image showed two Asian women. Tweaking it to “Asian woman with African American friend” yielded more accurate results.

> The image generator not being able to conceive of Asian people standing next to white people is egregious. But there are also more subtle indications of bias in what the system returns automatically. For example, I noticed Meta’s tool consistently represented “Asian women” as being East Asian-looking with light complexions, even though India is the most populous country in the world. It added culturally specific attire even when unprompted. It generated several older Asian men, but the Asian women were always young.

> AI systems reflect the biases of their creators, trainers, and the data set they use. In US media, “Asian” is usually taken to mean an East Asian person,as opposed to people from other parts of the continent — perhaps it’s not surprising that Meta’s system assumes all “Asian” people look the same, when, in fact, we’re a diverse collection of people who often have little in common besides ticking the same census box.

> Asians who don’t fit into the monolith are essentially erased from the cultural consciousness, and even those who do are [underrepresented](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/asians-pacific-islanders-battle-invisibility-media-hollywood/story?id=77753812) in mainstream media. Asians are homogenized, exoticized, and relegated to “[perpetual foreigners](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/11/30/asian-americans-and-the-forever-foreigner-stereotype/).” Breaking type is easy in real life and impossible in Meta’s AI system. Once again, generative AI, rather than allowing the imagination to take flight, imprisons it within a formalization of society’s dumber impulses.
