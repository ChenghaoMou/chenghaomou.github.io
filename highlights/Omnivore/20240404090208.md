## Highlights

> “I find GenZ to be strong believers in radical transparency. They want to know the ‘why’ behind many decisions. The speed with which they want to consume this information is also much higher than other generations. 
> 
> I have observed that GenZ have a stronger distrust of senior leadership than other generations. My hypothesis is that with the tech retraction in 2022-2023, this generation was going through its first downturn and thus questioned why there were no visible consequences for company leadership.

> GenZ seems more inspired by a strong sense of purpose and meaning, according to their older colleagues. Maybe this is why they’re seen as questioning everything: they want to know the _why_ of tasks and decisions, and to do things for the right reasons!
