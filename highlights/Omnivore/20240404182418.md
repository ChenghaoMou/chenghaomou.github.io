## Highlights

> [While publishers like Axel Springer have cut deals to license their companies' data to ChatGPT for training purposes](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/069c8981?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df), this money isn't flowing to the writers that create the content that OpenAI and Anthropic need to grow their models much further. It's also worth considering that these AI companies may already have already trained on this data.[ The Times sued OpenAI late last year for training itself on "millions" of articles](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/c71d0a95?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df), and I'd bet money that ChatGPT was trained on multiple Axel Springer publications along with anything else it could find publicly-available on the web.

> Paying publishers to license their content doesn't actually fix the problem, because it doesn't increase the amount of content that they create, but rather helps line the pockets of executives and shareholders. Ironically, OpenAI's best hope for survival would be to fund as many news outlets as possible and directly incentivize them to do in-depth reporting, rather than proliferating a tech that unquestionably harms the media industry.

> Yet the last few years have shown that the tech industry has become disconnected from reality, from good business, and from actually delivering value to real people outside of the investor class.

> I am sick and tired of watching billions of dollars burned on shitty ideas that don't work, and of those who continue to prop up the vague dreams of untouchable, ultra-rich technocrats. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/bubble-trouble-18eaa23d2cd#d5719db4-2f77-49d8-9e29-4d5f536dcf38)  ^d5719db4
