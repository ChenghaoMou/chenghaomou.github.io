> There were a lot of reasons why I left Apple. I was also tired of watching my friends get strung along with the promise of promotion, only to be disappointed after months and months of toiling with additional responsibility, no increase in pay, and the job instead going to an external hire brought in from some big box retailer. I was tired of feeling manipulated by the empty platitudes espoused by managers. I was tired of being told that I was valued for my unique skills and perspective, only to have my suggestions or concerns discarded in the next sentence.
