## Highlights

> While there are various technical ways AI systems could have data removed from them or “unlearn,” Mireshghallah says, there’s very little that’s known about the processes that are in place. The options can be buried or labor-intensive. Getting posts removed from AI training data is likely to be an uphill battle. Where companies are starting to allow opt-outs for future scraping or data sharing, they are almost always making users opt-in by default.

> “Most companies add the friction because they know that people aren’t going to go looking for it,” says Thorin Klosowski, a security and privacy activist at the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/). “Opt-in would be a purposeful action, as opposed to opting out, where you have to know it’s there.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai-wired-18ec85e2944#440ed777-d48a-47db-8637-3a6dd1f69bed)  ^440ed777

> While less common, some companies building AI tools and machine learning models don't automatically opt-in customers. “We do not train our models on user-submitted data by default. We may use user prompts and outputs to train Claude where the user gives us express permission to do so, such as clicking a thumbs up or down signal on a specific Claude output to provide us feedback,” says Jennifer Martinez, a spokesperson for [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/). In this situation, the most recent iteration of the company’s Claude chatbot is built on public information online and third-party data—content people posted elsewhere online—but not user information.
