## Highlights

> Nowadays we take it for granted that any time you run an internet search, most of what you find will be [Out To Get You](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/out-to-get-you). It’s content marketing cobbled together by chatbots, or by people who might as well be chatbots. It’s algorithmically optimized to squat in the top search results as part of someone’s marketing funnel. It’s propaganda by NGO hacks, or recent news articles on a different topic that shares a keyword, or literal paid advertisements, or something. Maybe it has a little bit of information about what you actually wanted, and maybe it’s a trailhead towards a deep and serious source, but you don’t expect to just… find what you’re looking for, presented straightforwardly.

> The hyperfocused specialists and weird nerds are still out there thinking and writing about their special interests, of course, but it’s much harder to find. You have to trace back sources and citations, or sift through the Twitter feed of a relatively knowledgeable author who mostly likes to yell about elections, or dig up the Youtube video with 86 views by a Turkish grandfather who just shows you how to replace the damn part, or you need to know a guy whose roommate is part of the right group chat. Maybe it’s out there, but you can’t just find it with a search.

> Worse, the weirdo specialists have a harder time finding _each other_. The days are gone when the people who are really interested in South Korean cement manufacturing could just Google the mailing list and start talking with each other. Instead they’re wandering through a desert of paid industry reports and Bloomberg articles. Productive discourse has retreated to walled gardens, and as a consequence there is much less of it.

> If most of their ostensible peers can’t discover new knowledge, then how will they find peers to work with? If most publications aren’t worth the time it takes to read, then who will bother to read the minority that are actually good?
