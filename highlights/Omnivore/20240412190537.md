## Highlights

> Levine mostly finds this amusing, and said that the bot stopped crawling his site sometime Thursday afternoon after he made the post. But it does show the sort of indiscriminate scraping of the internet that OpenAI is doing to train its AI models. And it shows that GPTBot, which OpenAI says “may potentially be used to improve future models,” is scraping sites that are obviously nonsensical to humans. This is something that also became clear when a group of researchers was able to trick ChatGPT into [spitting out some of its training data](https://www.404media.co/google-researchers-attack-convinces-chatgpt-to-reveal-its-training-data/) a few months ago.
