## Highlights

> Criticism of the practice has come from inside the company: Since the early days of Firefly, there has been internal disagreement on the ethics and optics of ingesting AI-generated imagery into the model, according to multiple employees familiar with its development who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Some have suggested weaning the system off generated images over time, but one of the people said there are no current plans to do so.

> Still, Adobe never made clear publicly that Firefly had trained in part on images from competitors’ tools that are supposedly less ethical. It did, however, outline such details in at least two online discussion groups the company runs on Discord — one for Adobe Stock and another devoted to Firefly — according to messages Bloomberg has viewed.
