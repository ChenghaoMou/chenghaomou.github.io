## Highlights

> Langchain is the perfect example of premature abstraction. We started out thinking _we had_ to use it because the internet said so. Instead, millions of tokens later, and probably 3-4 _very_ diverse LLM features in production, and our `openai_service` file still has only one, 40-line function in it:
> 
> def extract_json(prompt, variable_length_input, number_retries)
> 
> The only API we use is `chat`. We always extract json. We don’t need JSON mode, or function calling, or assistants (though we do all that). Heck, we don’t even use system prompts (maybe we should…). When a gpt-4-turbo was released, we updated one string in the codebase.
