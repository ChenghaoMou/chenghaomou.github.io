## Highlights

> This is the state of the modern internet — ultra-profitable platforms outright abdicating any responsibility toward the customer, offering not a "service" or a "portal," but cramming as many ways to interrupt the user and push them into doing things that make the company money. The greatest lie in tech is that Facebook and Instagram are for "catching up with your friends," because that's _no longer what they do_. These platforms are now pathways for the nebulous concept of "content discovery," a barely-personalized entertainment network that occasionally drizzles people or things you choose to see on top of sponsored content and groups that a relational database has decided are "good for you."

> Yet as I've noted before, I feel that enshittification misses one crucial thing — that these companies aren't doing this out of a lack of profitability or failure of their business model, but because the modern internet has become somewhere between a social experiment and a human mining operation.

> The core problem lies in the fact that these platforms don't really _create_ anything, and their only value exists in making an internet of billions of people small enough to comprehend. Like seemingly every problem with a capitalist society, the internet has become dominated by powerful forces that don't contribute to the product that enriches them. As a result, they have either no concept of nor interest in "quality," just "more," making them extremely poor arbiters of what "good" looks like. This inevitably leads to products that suck more as they become more profitable, because the machine they've built is a profit excavator dressed as a service.

> After profiting handsomely from being the middleman between content creation and internet users, big tech is in the process of looting the internet as a means of training models that it hopes can replace human beings themselves.

> It's the hallmark of a tech industry dedicated to creating problems that it charges you to solve, a sickly beast borne of venture capital and a lack of innovation. When you're rich and powerful, you no longer face real problems, and as a result fail to consider the solutions that would measurably improve a person's life. Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg don't worry about bills, or face actual busywork, or real challenges — they get paid[ hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/cf1ef87f?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df) to come up with ways to express growth to hedge funds.

> What use is all of this generative AI? Why is it necessary? Why does it have to happen? What is the killer app that makes any of this worthwhile? And why the fuck, for the third time in three years, is the tech industry trying to cram something down our throats that doesn't appear to help us?
> 
> The answer is obvious: because they believe it'll make them money. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/they-re-looting-the-internet-18ee31f66e9#a3b9618f-59d5-4e70-999a-1fc3a2ad60eb)  ^a3b9618f

> It's a new "thing" that tech can do that feels like the future, that sort of makes sense, that allows people who barely read anything and don't do any real work to dream of ways to get rid of the people who do.
