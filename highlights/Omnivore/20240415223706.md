## Highlights

> This specific group of AI images also has a series of group images where all of the teens are labeled as either “nonbinary” or, separately, as “happy teenage students.” These images imagine a world in which every nonbinary person has some variation of the exact same haircut and hair color and in which they exclusively hang out with and pose for pictures with other nonbinary students. AI-generated cis students in this series only hang out with other cis students, meanwhile.

> Sourojit Ghosh, a PhD candidate at the University of Washington and the lead researcher of the project, told 404 Media in an email that this erasure of nonbinary people had significant implications for harm. “It contributes to the historic trend of nonbinary identities being erased from mainstream representation, or nonbinary people facing oppression and/or violence simply for being nonbinary,” Ghosh said.
