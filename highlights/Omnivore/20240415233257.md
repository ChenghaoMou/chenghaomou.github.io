## Highlights

> What really bothers me though is Brockman’s closing, “Together, I believe that we can achieve the OpenAI mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.” I am just not seeing that as OpenAI’s mission, anymore, especially when they have continued to fail to compensate most of the creators whose work they are drawing on, largely without consent.

> As I put it to the Times, no company yet had A.I. technology that was sophisticated enough to make a virtual assistant answer questions reliably, “It’s almost like a broken watch being right twice a day. “It’s right some of the time, but you don’t know which part of the time, and that greatly diminishes its value.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-garymarcus-substack-com-p-ted-ai-and-the-test-of-time-18ee3e4538f#6163bd58-ba57-4583-88a6-decc27aef071)  ^6163bd58
