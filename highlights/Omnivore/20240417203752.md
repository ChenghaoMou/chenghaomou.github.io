## Highlights

> “Facebook is putting the onus on the group moderators / group members to detect and remove inappropriate answers,” Korolova added. “In an effort to increase engagement using AI, they are moving fast and breaking things. Responses like this from AI may have the opposite effect on engagement —destroying the authenticity of communication which still exists in some Facebook groups.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/facebook-s-ai-told-parents-group-it-has-a-gifted-disabled-child-18eed90c735#d2351908-6032-4244-aaa0-cb3b85f47d74)  ^d2351908

> This effect is seen by other posts from members of the group, which noted that the original poster was looking to have a real conversation with real humans in a community group for humans: “To reply with automated response generated from aggregating previous data is to fundamentally misunderstand the request, and to minimize or ignore why \[they\] were asking in a community group.” Another user wrote: “This is beyond creepy.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/facebook-s-ai-told-parents-group-it-has-a-gifted-disabled-child-18eed90c735#101785e5-1f4d-4c00-9ddc-7a3dce5d41de)  ^101785e5
