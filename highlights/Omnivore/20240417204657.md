# Clap Or AI Gets It - Aftermath

## Highlights

> Like the threat behind crypto’s “[have fun staying poor](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/03/the-decoder-have-fun-staying-poor/)” slogan, AI needs the rest of us to believe in its unstoppable ascendancy because that belief is basically all it has. AI products aren’t about whether anyone wants or needs AI products. They’re about how people _could_ want or need those products, eventually, if everyone stays the course and also keeps pumping money into AI companies. You can call a product bad as long as you immediately point out that _obviously_ it’s going to become good (Brownlee even nods to this in his Humane review, saying that the pin is “the new worst product I’ve ever reviewed in its current state”), because AI products are less products and more promotional tools for _the future_, for _technological advancement,_ for whatever other big concepts Silicon Valley goons trot out to throw a smokescreen over the [barely-functional](https://aftermath.site/openai-sora-scam-sillicon-valley), largely useless junk they need us to believe is inevitable.
