## Highlights

> But I want to be clear: No one is under any obligation to be nice to the creators of the Humane pin or the product itself, which, even if it worked, is a gadget that relies on mass content theft and the scraping of huge amounts of human knowledge and creativity to make a product that is marketed as making us more “human.” The people making this argument are people who have a vested interest in the general public continuing to canonize, support, and spend money on a Silicon Valley vision of the future that involves the automation of everything, the displacement of huge numbers of workers, and a new, AI-led internet that has so far done little but [flooded the web with low quality junk](https://www.404media.co/facebook-is-being-overrun-with-stolen-ai-generated-images-that-people-think-are-real/), been used to make fake porn to harass women, and has led eager beaver know nothing CEOs to prematurely lay off huge numbers of workers to [replace them with AI tools](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/12/business/dukaan-ceo-layoffs-ai-chatbot/index.html?ref=404media.co) built on the back of uncompensated human labor and training largely done by underpaid “ghost workers” [in the developing world](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/?ref=404media.co).

> But it is not mean, or unethical, or distasteful to say that disappointing things are disappointing and are not worth spending large amounts of money on to support some hope that maybe in the future the same people who made this very bad product at great expense will make a version of it that will suck less. It is absurd to suggest otherwise. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/we-can-and-we-must-clown-on-the-humane-ai-pin-forever-18ef2ebcd55#6cb85036-396a-4de5-b10f-e0e54caa4f07)  ^6cb85036
