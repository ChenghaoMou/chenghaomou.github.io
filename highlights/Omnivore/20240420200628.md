## Highlights

> One pertinent unresolved question is whether copyright, the foundational IP mechanism open source licensing is based on, can be applied to the various components and pieces of an AI project, in particular a model’s inner scaffolding (e.g. [embeddings](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-are-embeddings/#:~:text=Since%20embeddings%20make%20it%20possible,for%20artificial%20intelligence%20%28AI%29.&text=Technically%2C%20embeddings%20are%20vectors%20created,meaningful%20data%20about%20each%20object.)). Then, there’s the mismatch between the perception of open source and how AI actually functions to overcome: open source was devised in part to ensure that developers could study and modify code without restrictions. With AI, though, which ingredients you need to do the studying and modifying is open to interpretation.
