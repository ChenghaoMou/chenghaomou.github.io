## Highlights

> Many people with low self-esteem get in the habit of being hypercritical of others because criticism and judgment of other people leads to a feeling of self-righteous anger. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-thefriendlymind-com-4-things-about-anger-everyone-shou-18f02788f13#8dfae2c9-0416-432f-b4dc-a312294c0e16)  ^8dfae2c9

> Instead, they consume a lot of news, which leads to a lot of anger at “all those idiots out there,” which numbs out the feelings of helplessness (and even guilt) that comes from caring about issues but not actually doing anything about them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-thefriendlymind-com-4-things-about-anger-everyone-shou-18f02788f13#e1118614-379e-42ad-8571-b8b20cb89b09)  ^e1118614

> By criticizing other people, we superficially boost our own self-esteem. And because this brief self-esteem boost feels so good, we get addicted to the high and continue to dwell on the emotion, often to the point of obsession, which only increases its intensity and salience in our mind.

> **The motivation behind validation is to do better.** When we validate an emotion like anger, we simply acknowledge that it’s okay and normal to feel that way, so that we can move past it in a healthy way and get on with our lives. Validation is the healthy middle ground between avoidance and obsession. And while it often does result in us feeling better, that’s a nice side effect not the primary function.
