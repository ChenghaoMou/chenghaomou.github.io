## Highlights

> Instagram is profiting from several ads that invite people to create nonconsensual nude images with AI image generation apps, once again showing that some of the most harmful applications of AI tools are not hidden on the dark corners of the internet, but are actively promoted to users by social media companies unable or unwilling to enforce their policies about who can buy ads on their platforms.

> Mobile face swapping apps that are available via the Google and Apple app stores are common, and are yet another way that nonconsensual AI-generated porn is becoming easier to produce. The use of these “undress” apps has spread to [schools](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/little-recourse-teens-girls-victimized-ai-deepfake-nudes-rcna126399?ref=404media.co) across the country, and recently resulted in the [arrest](https://www.wired.com/story/florida-teens-arrested-deepfake-nudes-classmates/?ref=404media.co) of two middle school students in Florida. We’ve recently [covered a case in a Washington State high school](https://www.404media.co/what-was-she-supposed-to-report-police-report-shows-how-a-high-school-deepfake-nightmare-unfolded/) where several students were investigated by the police for using an “undress” app that takes a real photograph of a person and makes them appear nude. In that story, the police report indicates the students found the app on TikTok, which previous [reporting](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7b4b3/x-lags-behind-tiktok-meta-in-restricting-nudify-apps-for-non-consensual-ai-porn?ref=404media.co) has shown also promoted these types of apps. In December, we [reported](https://www.404media.co/twitter-x-now-showing-ads-for-nonconsensual-ai-undress-apps/) that Twitter was also showing ads for these apps.
