## Highlights

> And that is: I think A.I. is a poison to the creative process. I think it makes your work worse and makes you less interesting and less employable. And that’s what I think is worth talking about today. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-a-i-lie-muddy-colors-18f14599b81#e5816ba4-0a96-4b4c-8e61-880605f9ce23)  ^e5816ba4

> It does not know and can not know what meaning its outputs have. Further, it has no desire and no emotion to motivate action or decisions. It simply runs a program and assembles pixels or words to match what seems most like other correct pixels and words in its vast data set. It aggregates. It produces averages. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-a-i-lie-muddy-colors-18f14599b81#d8090771-2cbd-488e-93f7-4b8a7ef656d2)  ^d8090771

> Humans, obviously, do not create like this. Humans have intentions and purpose to what we do. These intentions are sometimes deep, sometimes shallow, sometime clear, and sometimes nebulous. But we always have emotion and thought connected to what we make. What we create is guided by intent colliding with discovery, and these two states feed each other. And the influence that we draw from existing work is not an analysis of pixels, but an emotional response to how that work makes us feel. Even in analytical study of form or anatomy, our brains do not operate like computer programs. While committing information to memory, we also interpret and seek to understand and this affects how that information is later able to be used. Because we are each an individual, infinitely complex being, our different physiological, environmental, and cultural variations bring us to infinite different endpoints. Like it or not, we all see the world slightly differently and our creative expressions reflect this. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-a-i-lie-muddy-colors-18f14599b81#dec7a3b8-5e8e-407b-a723-0dc463840744)  ^dec7a3b8

> A.I. is a service. You cede control and decisions to an A.I. in the way you might to an independent contractor hired to do a job that you do not want to or are unable to do. This is important to how using A.I. in a creative workflow will influence your end result. You are, at best, taking on a collaborator. And this collaborator happens to be a mindless average aggregate of data. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-a-i-lie-muddy-colors-18f14599b81#34917714-1c10-4e56-8756-894d127216ff)  ^34917714

> But every percent that you hand over to the A.I. is a percent less of your unique voice, perspective, and intention. And for folks who use A.I. generations wholesale, that comes out to a 100% loss of anything personal or unique that they might bring.

> Though they might dramatically speed up or replace parts of a workflow, the short and long term costs are appalling to me. It is removing my own hand, the single most valuable asset I possess, from the creation of my work. Even used for prelim work or “inspiration” as I’ve heard other folks occasionally say, I see it as contracting out something crucially important to the lowest bidder. The early stages set in motion everything that follows. They are what the entire creative work is built around. To hire that out to a robot is to value the robot’s decisions above my own, existing only to paint-by-numbers a design that I did not create. And I believe outsourcing segments of the workflow also degrades one’s abilities, making you more dependent on the service. So if you value your mind, spirit, and vision at all as important components to your work, this should be a non-starter. And if you don’t value those things, you might consider another line of work altogether, because that is what makes an artist’s career possible.

> The central lie behind these programs is that they are meant for artists. They’re not. We don’t need them and using them only hurts us. What our clients really need from us is what the A.I. button cannot and never will be able to give: a human expression in all its flawed, beautiful glory.
