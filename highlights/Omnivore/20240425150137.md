## Highlights

> When I write, I push myself to make definite positive claims. Ambiguity allows thought to remain fluid on the page, floating into a different meaning when put under pressure. This makes it harder to push your thinking deeper. By making clear and sharp claims, I reveal my understanding so that I—or the person I’m writing to—can see the state of my knowledge and direct their feedback to the point where it will help my thinking improve. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-think-in-writing-18f158fd093#ef6ffcc1-1c06-4054-883e-0fa1ac4ab557)  ^ef6ffcc1

> In the terminology of mathematics, what I did here (and in my writing) was to “make a conjecture,” a qualified guess based on limited information. A hypothesis. The mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, whom Johanna and I [have written about elsewhere](https://substack.com/redirect/df9f2edc-85a2-4fc0-869c-04440b26bbbe?j=eyJ1IjoiM21rczdnIn0.mQRlMx5RtLtBGkuhCkWSJBhiu%5FU4D37UF8lUPWMNg1Y), would always summarize his first impression of a new situation with a conjecture, proclaiming with irrepressible enthusiasm, “It must be true!” Ten seconds later, someone would come up with a counterexample that proved him wrong. But being right wasn’t the point: getting a better understanding was. And he would immediately throw out a new conjecture. (Holden Karnofsky has a blog post about using this technique to [learn through writing](https://substack.com/redirect/3efa7f00-3a85-4d90-a400-9b31d6278af5?j=eyJ1IjoiM21rczdnIn0.mQRlMx5RtLtBGkuhCkWSJBhiu%5FU4D37UF8lUPWMNg1Y).)

> Once I unfold my understanding in writing, I often see holes right away. I start correcting myself and discarding ideas already while typing. I cut ideas that are obviously flawed. I rewrite what feels ambiguous to make it sharper–more precise, concrete, unhedged, and true to my understanding.
> 
> The flaws I see immediately, however, are only the more superficial flaws. The deeper patterns take a longer time to emerge—because they are further from your established thoughts and so are harder to articulate.

> Other times, the counterexample you find undermines the whole idea—a _global counterexample_. You unfold your conclusion and discover that one of the premises does not hold up, and there is no way to patch it. The fracture spreads right up to the conclusion. Now—this is what we have been longing for—there is a big hole of confusion where before there was a mental model. It is time to replace it with something more subtle and deep that incorporates the critique.
