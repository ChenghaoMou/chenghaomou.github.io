## Highlights

> I want to work with _serious_ people who are good at their jobs, affirming to spend time with, and the company doesn't waste hours of my time on meetings or placating dysfunctional leadership. I'm willing to take a title _and_ a pay cut (and expect to do so when working with people who are hopefully going to be teaching me how to do this whole thing better).

> That is not to say that _it is impossible to find good work_, just that while the job market is large, the _good_ job market is tiny. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/most-tech-jobs-are-jokes-and-i-am-not-laughing-ludicity-18f16b8b0d5#a48eac65-f0e3-4d2f-b560-e2f5362747de)  ^a48eac65

> These responsories are an echo from twenty-one hundred years ago, when the venerable first-century-BCE rabbi, Hillel, encouraged in his mishnah, "If not now, when?" This simple and powerful encouragement to go on with the journey has been expressed in different words, at different times, to the yearning but timid, to the uncertain, the jaded, the hesitant, the dawdlers, the postponers, the fakers, the foolish, and the wise. Thus, since the beginning of time, humanity has lurched, walked, crawled, dragged, and danced itself forward toward the fullest life with soul possible.
