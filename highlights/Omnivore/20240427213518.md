## Highlights

> In any case, conventional academics will be increasingly challenged. Ironically, plumbers and electricians won’t be so easily replaced, a fact sometimes attributed to the Moravec paradox. Steven Pinker wrote in 1994 that cooks and gardeners are secured in their jobs for decades to come, unlike stock market analysis and engineers. But I suspect that the principle even extends within the academy: some work, like conducting actual experiments, is harder to automate than producing and running models. The theoretical work is likely more impacted by intelligence artificial than more applied, concrete work.
