## Highlights

> One of the major themes of _Taming Silicon Valley_ is the need for independent oversight; as the old proverb so rightly puts it, the fox can’t guard the henhouse. I talk, for example, about how Washington often gets co-opted by lobbyists, and stress the need for independent scientists to be at the table, both as we develop policy and as we make sure that our new technologies are safe.

> When I groused about this yesterday to a friend who is well-connected in Washington, the friend reminded me that part of the problem is the revolving door: “Everyone who is in \[Washington\] and wants to leave \[after the election\] wants to go to an AI company.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-garymarcus-substack-com-p-we-cant-trust-the-fox-to-guard-t-18f214792d0#b9fc80a2-ea25-4e72-a90d-5709e18a80ea)  ^b9fc80a2

> It’s almost impossible to envision the independence we might need when nobody in Washington knows where they will be come January, and pots of gold await in the Bay Area. Especially when essentially everyone in Washington is underpaid.
