## Highlights

> Inference is always a single pass. LLMs can't stop, gather world state, reason, revisit older answers or predict future answers, unless that process also is detailed in the training data. If you include the previous prompts and responses, that still leaves the next inference starting from scratch as another single pass. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-strangeloopcanon-com-p-what-can-llms-never-do-18f1fda36a9#5229d34e-13e0-43fe-ba50-d03cfaccb8a3)  ^5229d34e

> That creates a problem, which is that there is inevitably a form of ‘goal drift’ where inference gets less reliable. (This is also why forms of prompt injections work, because it distorts the attention mechanism.) This ‘goal drift’ means that agents, or tasks done in a sequence with iteration, get less reliable. It ‘forgets’ where to focus, because its attention is not selective nor dynamic.

> Which is why I am officially willing to bite the bullet. **Sufficiently scaled up statistics is indistinguishable from intelligence, within the distribution of the training data**. Not for everything and not enough to do everything, but it's not a mirage either. That’s why it’s the mistakes from the tests that are far more useful for diagnoses, than the successes.
