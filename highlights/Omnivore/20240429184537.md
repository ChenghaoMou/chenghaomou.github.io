## Highlights

> And this is the man selling the artificial intelligence dream — a salesman capable of superficial connection of ideas in a way that’s initially satisfying, as long as you don’t think about it too much. Altman’s famed “[startup playbook](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/e0cd74b3?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df),” published in 2015, is full of the kind of obvious-yet-satisfying pablum that you’d expect. He extolled the virtues of being “flexible yet rigid,” advises that you “talk to your users and watch them use your product” (which is an exact quote), and try to “improve your product 5% every week.” These are the kind of things that are very useful to an early-20s founder and impressive to a mid-50s white venture capitalist that doesn’t remember the last time they worked a job that wasn’t ten hours a week of investing in Chuntly, the SaaS for Dog Breeders. They’re the tech equivalent of a “Live, Laugh, Love” bumper sticker. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-up-18f2af6517e#9459a44d-f671-4222-baea-bb53de6210d1)  ^9459a44d

> If left unchecked, OpenAI will perpetuate one of the largest thefts in history, looting the internet and using it to train models that have yet to prove their necessity other than as a symbol that Silicon Valley can still innovate.

> Silicon Valley will continue to suffer as long as we entrust the future to management consultants and showmen who don’t build software.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-up-18f2af6517e#d57c595a-d3e6-4247-9b01-c0e614f9c296)  ^d57c595a

> When you’re insulated from real people’s problems and don’t participate in the process that might actually solve them, you’re fundamentally disconnected from any real value creation. Silicon Valley is atrophying as a result of lazy, disconnected venture capitalists and power players elevating men like Sam Altman to positions of power, and incumbents helping career consultants dictate the actions of those who actually build software and hardware.
> 
> If the tech industry wants to escape the public’s ire, it should push back against managerial poison, and talk to real people with real problems and focus on solving those before creating yet another growth-centric investor-friendly doodad.
