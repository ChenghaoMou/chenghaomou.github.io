## Highlights

> We found that this gap was because we were always using the most recent Common Crawl when doing ablations. We removed this filter and pulled from CommonCrawl going back 10 years and — _voila_! — we matched (actually slightly exceeded) the high precision dataset’s performance. Our hypothesis for why this is happening is that Common Crawl is blocked more in recent years and it’s possible that crawl quality is declining over time.
