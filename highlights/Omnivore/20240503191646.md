## Highlights

> First, I often ask ChatGPT to ask me questions about a feature I’m building so I can flesh out anything that’s underspecified before it starts to plan how to build the feature. This helps make my thinking sharper and its plan more likely to be correct. We’re building a shared model of the feature together step-by-step—so we’re both clear on what it should look like at the end.

> There are some easy solutions —some on CW’s side and some on mine. On the CW side, it would be awesome if, after I inputted a task, CW initiated a chat session to help expand upon what I actually want before it moves on to a specification. Sometimes I don’t know yet! I only have a vague idea, and I wish it would force me to get more clear so that we build up our understanding of what needs to be done together.

> On my end, using a tool like this effectively will involve learning to understand what kinds of tasks it can handle, how hefty an assignment it can handle by itself, and then using it explicitly for that. I need to learn how to be a good [model manager](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/the-knowledge-economy-is-over-welcome-to-the-allocation-economy) for this kind of model.
