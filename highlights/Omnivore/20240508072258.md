## Highlights

> Shortcuts tend to be pragmatic and goal-directed; you cut across the grass to save ten seconds on your way to the library. Longcuts are more about enabling; opening up a space for activities. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/on-shortcuts-and-longcuts-18f56de9157#392ffa38-19f3-46a6-8276-e28d6b9e5029)  ^392ffa38

> It is tempting to make shortcuts. When writing or doing art or building software (or in any other way constructing paths for people to walk on), you can typically earn more if you cater to the marginal user, the one who is on the fence. But [the marginal user is the least patient and least interested](https://substack.com/redirect/74a1c107-8413-44ee-aa2a-b662fd0546e4?j=eyJ1IjoiM21rczdnIn0.mQRlMx5RtLtBGkuhCkWSJBhiu%5FU4D37UF8lUPWMNg1Y), so you have to simplify, reduce friction, make the path direct and unambiguous—and you end up working for the shortcut paving company.
