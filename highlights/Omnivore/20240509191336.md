# OpenAI releases “Our approach to content and data in the age of AI.” Let’s look under the hood | by Neil Turkewitz | May, 2024 | Medium

## Highlights

> “Continuing to improve” isn’t an acknowledgement of present injustice. Indeed, elsewhere in the document OpenAI alleges it is under no legal obligation to refrain from using creative works without consent, suggesting it is only their magnanimity leading them to adopt a new path. This is not the language of a company dedicated to meaningful change.

> The very predicate for their Media Manager is legally and morally suspect. We don’t really need novel solutions — we need the application of traditional business principles and the application of law. The alleged complexity evaporates.

> There are countless examples of models regurgitating content. What matters more — what the models were designed to do, or what they actually do? In addition, this comment reflects a complete misunderstanding of the harms associated with derivative AI output. The danger isn’t limited to specific output that closely resembles specific training data — it’s that the entirety of AI output, trained on creative works without consent, then unfairly competes in marketplaces with the creators of the original works.
