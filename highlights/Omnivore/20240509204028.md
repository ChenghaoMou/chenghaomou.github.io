# On TTS audio description – Robert Kingett

## Highlights

> Audio description is for blind people but is often provided by sighted people without any input from the very blind audience it’s supposed to be for because sighted people believe that just because they have sight, they know how to obtain information better than we do. It’s the same dismissal found in text to speech audio description. [Blind audio description writers, like me,](https://robertkingett.com/posts/5732/) aren’t taken seriously in the audio description space because, after all, how are we going to describe something we can’t see? This is their logic, not mine. TTS AD and has this same kind of mindset. We don’t matter. Here’s your thing, go away.
