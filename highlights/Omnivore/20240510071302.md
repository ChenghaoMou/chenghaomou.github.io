## Highlights

> The unsealed letter from OpenAI's lawyers, which is labeled "highly confidential - attorneys' eyes only," says that the use of "books1" and "books2" for model training was discontinued in late 2021 and that the datasets were deleted in mid-2022 because of their nonuse. The letter goes on to say that none of the other data used to train GPT-3 has been deleted and offers attorneys for the Authors Guild access to those other datasets.
