## Highlights

> Without it, I find myself getting grumpy a lot more often when I need to write boilerplate code - "Ugh, Copilot would have done it for me!", and now I have to type it all out myself. That being said, the answer to my question above is a very definite "no, I am more productive without it". Let me explain. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-trace-yshui-dev-2024-05-copilot-html-18f7095a74c#62ac542b-ce7c-409d-b450-92f793b997c5)  ^62ac542b

> Copilot can be really really helpful when it gets things right, however, it's really difficult to predict what it will get right, and what it won't. After a year of working with Copilot, I would say I am better at that than when I first started using it, but I have yet to fully grasp all the intricacies.

> The intuition you've developed through a lifetime's interaction with other humans, is not going to work with an AI. Which means, short of letting Copilot actually try, there is oftentimes no surefire way to know whether it's going to work or not.

> Compared to that, Copilot is much _much_ slower. I would wait at least 2\~3 seconds to get _any_ suggestion from Copilot. If Copilot decided, for whatever reason, to write a large chunk of code, it would take a lot longer. And in many instances I would wait all those seconds only to see Copilot spit out unusable code. And I would have to decide if I need to refine the instructions in comments and try again; or partially accept the suggestion and do the rest myself.
