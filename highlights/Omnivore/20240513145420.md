## Highlights

> So when a startup comes to me with an idea for an experiment, the one thing I tell them is: make sure that there’s a well-defined distinction between success and failure. Don't fall in the messy middle. If the hypothesis fails, make sure it fails clearly and unambiguously; if it succeeds, make sure it succeeds equally clearly and unambiguously. And remember that a hypothesis failing means the experiment succeeded; you learned something. That’s what it's all about.
