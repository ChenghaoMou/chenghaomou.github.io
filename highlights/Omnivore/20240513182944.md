# Expectations Versus Reality

[Read Original](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/bf3600d1?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df)

## Highlights

> Yet the press [credulously](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/b61ada6d?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df) [accepted](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/a0bf0941?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df) Sora’s “[stunning](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/5beb7869?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df)” videos that were “[amazing and scary](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/fab744c2?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df),” suggesting to the public that we were on the verge of some sort of AI takeover of the film industry, helping buoy Sam Altman’s attempts to “[convince Hollywood that Sora won’t destroy the movie business](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/d4ac7369?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df).” These stories only serve to help Sam Altman, who desperately needs you to believe that Hollywood is scared of Sora and generative AI, because the more you talk about _fear_ and _lost jobs_ and _the machines taking over_, the less you ask a very simple question: does any of this shit actually work? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/expectations-versus-reality-18f7300d026#a67bf4a1-10b6-48f2-85c5-a71eadd27efc)  ^a67bf4a1

> Yet these tiny little problems all lead to one overwhelming issue: that Sora isn’t so much a tool to make movies as it is a slot machine that spits out footage that may or may not be of any use at all. Almost all of the footage in Air Head was graded, treated, stabilized and upscaled, as that 10-20 minute lead time on generations was for _footage in 480p resolution,_ meaning that even useful footage needed significant post production work to look good enough. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/expectations-versus-reality-18f7300d026#80af3a20-0711-4670-8dbe-f91502fbe114)  ^80af3a20

> To put it as plainly as possible, every single time that Shy Kids wanted to generate a shot — even a 3-second-long one — they would give Sora a text prompt, and wait for _at least ten minutes_ to find out if it was right, regularly accepting footage that was subprime or inaccurate, the best example being that many of Air Head’s shots are in slow motion, a hallucination that Shy Kids never asked for but had to accept because the shot was otherwise what they needed. This caused them to have to do “quite a bit of adjusting ...to keep it all from feeling like a big slowmo project,” which I’d argue it still does. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/expectations-versus-reality-18f7300d026#6eb59234-9283-4beb-a700-f24c5063626e)  ^6eb59234

> But every day real people are working more to earn fewer dollars that don’t go as far, and the tech industry’s response is to create obtuse bullshit that doesn’t help anybody. [Why does the Humane Pin exist](https://www.wheresyoured.at/r/f0f4f7c7?m=f0d0d9e8-9c6d-4891-a403-ddb4298b33df)? Who is that for? How did Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno ship out such an unbelievably useless piece of shit? Is this a case of abject negligence or abject opportunism? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/expectations-versus-reality-18f7300d026#d7ce3d98-f67c-4800-94b6-2e3200751e20)  ^d7ce3d98

> _This_ is the rot in the tech industry — cults of personality enabling cults of personality to pretend that they’re doing great things as they crap out the great contributions to our nation’s landfills. By all means be excited about what they might be building, celebrate their actual victories, but exile anyone who dares to try and tell you sell you their half-baked dreams.
