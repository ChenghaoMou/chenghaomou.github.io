## Highlights

> During the annual review, the AI can randomly give you a score - no worse than your clueless manager. It will quote something "naughty" you did just the week before the review as an indicator of a year-long bad behavior on your behalf, and the reason, of course, why you must be given the center of Bell Curve rating and no raise.

> If you complain, the AI can proverbially nod and then repeat itself, dismissing everything you just said.
> 
> The AI can "walk" around the office space and spew sentences that include phrases like "action item", "top priority", "stakeholders", "low hanging fruit", and alike.
