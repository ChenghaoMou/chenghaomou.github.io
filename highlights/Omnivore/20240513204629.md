# Rules of Machine Learning:  |  Google for Developers

## Highlights

> do machine learning like the great engineer you are, not like the great machine learning expert you aren’t. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#ba5f45eb-d7ea-42f7-a483-682ee07bc081)  ^ba5f45eb

> * Make sure your pipeline is solid end to end.
> * Start with a reasonable objective.
> * Add common­-sense features in a simple way.
> * Make sure that your pipeline stays solid. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#12abccb5-6b43-4e0c-847b-5ba5a97237b5)  ^12abccb5

> Rule #1: Don’t be afraid to launch a product without machine learning. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#8b940ab1-8240-4c77-9399-573f915190d5)  ^8b940ab1

> Rule #2: First, design and implement metrics. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#4c2a339b-9136-4288-a5ac-369c82cee4b8)  ^4c2a339b

> Before formalizing what your machine learning system will do, track as much as possible in your current system. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#d7200a0e-36cc-4d83-8471-9629dc282246)  ^d7200a0e

> #### Rule #3: Choose machine learning over a complex heuristic.
> 
> A simple heuristic can get your product out the door. A complex heuristic is unmaintainable. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#e7dd7b16-4136-4463-999b-cfff347bbf36)  ^e7dd7b16

> The first model provides the biggest boost to your product, so it doesn't need to be fancy. But you will run into many more infrastructure issues than you expect. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#cdb42f1c-356e-4106-93e7-fe1b807d32a1)  ^cdb42f1c

> #### Rule #5: Test the infrastructure independently from the machine learning.
> 
> Make sure that the infrastructure is testable, and that the learning parts of the system are encapsulated so that you can test everything around it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#989cca82-b038-46ad-a47b-c22fe1082fbc)  ^989cca82

> Rule #6: Be careful about dropped data when copying pipelines. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#49418516-3ed1-4fc1-ae01-aca51b58bbea)  ^49418516

> Do be mindful of the added complexity when using heuristics in an ML system. Using old heuristics in your new machine learning algorithm can help to create a smooth transition, but think about whether there is a simpler way to accomplish the same effect. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#33a633af-8010-42b9-bd9d-e9cf85b6f1b1)  ^33a633af

> #### Rule #9: Detect problems before exporting models.
> 
> Many machine learning systems have a stage where you export the model to serving. If there is an issue with an exported model, it is a user­-facing issue.
> 
> Do sanity checks right before you export the model. Specifically, make sure that the model’s performance is reasonable on held out data. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#0e012ee1-8670-4773-a6d5-036a9d7c6bf6)  ^0e012ee1

> #### Rule #11: Give feature columns owners and documentation.
> 
> If the system is large, and there are many feature columns, know who created or is maintaining each feature column. If you find that the person who understands a feature column is leaving, make sure that someone has the information. Although many feature columns have descriptive names, it's good to have a more detailed description of what the feature is, where it came from, and how it is expected to help. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rules-of-machine-learning-google-for-developers-18f737e0377#8dc389ed-b154-47f2-9421-c7ef9c2347dd)  ^8dc389ed

> Finally, don’t try to get the machine learning to figure out:
> 
> * Is the user happy using the product?
> * Is the user satisfied with the experience?
> * Is the product improving the user’s overall well­being?
> * How will this affect the company’s overall health?
> 
> These are all important, but also incredibly hard to measure. Instead, use proxies: if the user is happy, they will stay on the site longer. If the user is satisfied, they will visit again tomorrow. Insofar as well-being and company health is concerned, human judgement is required to connect any machine learned objective to the nature of the product you are selling and your business plan.
