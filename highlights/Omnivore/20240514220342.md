# OpenAI’s GPT-4o Isn’t ‘Her,’ It’s ‘Metropolis’

## Highlights

> OpenAI has missed the point of _Her_, as many in Silicon Valley do when confronted with media literacy that would require them to introspect before forging ahead. Johansson herself has [called the internet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/30/fake-porn-videos-are-being-weaponized-harass-humiliate-women-everybody-is-potential-target/?ref=404media.co) “a vast wormhole of darkness that eats itself.” Although she said this in the context of deepfakes (which she is often a target of), it feels appropriate for what OpenAI has long been criticized for doing: eating the entire creative output of anyone on internet and beyond to build its models, without regard to ownership or rights. GPT-4o’s voice isn’t a clone of Johansson's voice. It’s legion, a clone of all of our voices, all of our words and writing and language.

> Feminine voices in AI helping roles reinforce stereotypes about women as being subservient, a fact that’s been studied extensively. Like many voice assistants, you can opt to change the tone of GPT-4o’s voice, but the default is a female voice, and most of the demos released by the company have featured the same female voice. Again, OpenAI knows what it’s doing here. It would not have gone as viral as it has without that voice. People read the voice as flirty because it never quite asserts itself: it’s always a little unsure of its responses, even when literally leading a blind man around a city.

> If people fall in love with OpenAI’s newest product, it’ll be because it’s a mirror of themselves that will never challenge, confront, or confuse them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/open-ai-s-gpt-4-o-isn-t-her-it-s-metropolis-18f78eb1168#d88b1391-6cbd-4f69-8806-2bf6e3cdd9c6)  ^d88b1391
