## Highlights

> The “dead internet” is a process of [direct information platform exploitation](https://old.reddit.com/r/ClicBot/comments/1chlcnk/from%5Fdebt%5Fto%5Fwealth%5Fmy%5Fpersonal%5Ffinance%5Fsuccess/) by manipulative people operating on unchecked-and-unauthenticated platforms drawn to running scams due to their life circumstances (we’re ignoring the other branch of [politically controlled “information warfare”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian%5Fweb%5Fbrigades) scams for now). Bot/scam/advertising/affiliate manipulation is born from usually living in low income societies where the most logical upward trajectory is just exploiting and manipulating high income people and societies who aren’t their own people (much like how a good way to stop spyware is changing your windows locale to russia because russian spyware firms don’t attack their own).
