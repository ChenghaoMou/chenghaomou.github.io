## Highlights

> Whatever labor funded the production of knowledge that it refers to goes unmentioned, and whatever sources it relies on go uncredited. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/google-s-broken-link-to-the-web-18f7b562af6#08e6183a-9eb2-4bc1-8496-15bb94c5f1cb)  ^08e6183a

> But to everyone who depended even a little bit on web search to have their business discovered, or their blog post read, or their journalism funded, the arrival of AI search bodes ill for the future. Google will now do the Googling for you, and everyone who benefited from humans doing the Googling will very soon need to come up with a Plan B.
