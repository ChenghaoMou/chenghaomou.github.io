> Screenshots of Google’s AI search going awry have gone repeatedly viral and highlight how hellbent the company is on giving its customers the most frustrating possible user experience while [casually destroying the livelihoods](https://housefresh.com/how-google-decimated-housefresh/?ref=404media.co) of people who work for or make websites.
