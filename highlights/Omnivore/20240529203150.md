# Information is Relational • Buttondown

## Highlights

> When Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI try to insert so-called “AI” systems (driven by LLMs) between information seekers and information providers, they are interrupting the ability to make and maintain those relationships. (They are also disrupting the economic relationships that information providers enter into: If the search website displays answers directly, information seekers don't click through to the underlying pages, and those pages lose advertising revenue. But that is not my focus here.) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/information-is-relational-buttondown-18fc5d65bc3#090b6424-3269-439e-9b60-61d23d5803ac)  ^090b6424

> If instead of the 10 blue links, you get an answer from a chatbot that reproduces information from some or all of these four options (let's assume it even does so reliably), you've lost the ability to situate the information in its context. And, in this example, you've lost the opportunity to serendipitously discover the existence of the community in the forum. Worse still, if this is frequently how you get access to information, you lose the opportunity to build up your own understanding of the landscape around you in the information ecosystem.
