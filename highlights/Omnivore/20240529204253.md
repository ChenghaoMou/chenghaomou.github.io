## Highlights

> A “growing number” of child sex offenders are training Stable Diffusuion models on datasets of real child sexual abuse material, according to a 2024 OCCIT report about CSAM AI models shared with 404 Media. “The results are AI models that excel in the production of the most graphic abuse materials imaginable, much of which is now indistinguishable from reality to the naked eye,” the report says. “These custom models are trained and distributed online, entirely for the sexual gratification of pedophiles.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/ai-generated-child-sexual-abuse-material-is-not-a-victimless-cri-18fc5e079ab#0cca2dd0-e9c8-4528-87dc-340553c60098)  ^0cca2dd0

> models trained on real sexual abuse is that it makes it much harder to remove that abuse from the internet. Sometimes, that’s because AI image generators make it so easy to create thousands and thousands of images. Other times, the AI-generated CSAM might not look like a specific human being, but is powered by real images of abuse. In both cases, AI-generated CSAM is far from a “victimless crime.” Quite the opposite, it is a crime that uses cutting edge technology to extend that abuse in a way that just a few years ago was not humanly possible.
