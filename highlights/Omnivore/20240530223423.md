## Highlights

> The First Law of Software Complexity: **A well-designed system will degrade into a badly designed system over time.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/three-laws-of-software-complexity-or-why-software-engineers-are--18fcb6ce849#e47b053e-ffc1-452b-8be3-99b829c592fb)  ^e47b053e

> It follows that a well-designed system is an unstable, ephemeral state; whereas a badly designed system is a stable, persistent state. Accordingly, the mix of systems in the wild continuously degrades towards poor design. The second derivative of code is always negative in the wild: the rate at which code can change goes down over time. Based on this law, most engineers will work on badly designed systems because **_most systems turn into badly designed systems over time_**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/three-laws-of-software-complexity-or-why-software-engineers-are--18fcb6ce849#7875331f-6744-40d1-8eef-efd86d2d3906)  ^7875331f

> #### The Second Law of Software Complexity: **Complexity is a Moat (filled by Leaky Abstractions)**.
> 
> Designing a good abstraction is a delicate dance between providing utility to the application while hiding detail about the implementation. When systems compete with each other for market share, delicacy goes out the window and designers often give the application everything it wants.

> Based on this law, most engineers will work on badly designed systems because **_most successful/popular systems are badly designed systems_**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/three-laws-of-software-complexity-or-why-software-engineers-are--18fcb6ce849#fa27bf3b-faa2-49f2-9635-885425d9d591)  ^fa27bf3b

> The Third Law of Software Complexity: **There is no fundamental upper limit on Software Complexity**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/three-laws-of-software-complexity-or-why-software-engineers-are--18fcb6ce849#da4bb8db-021b-4009-8e3d-cbabfe2421ac)  ^da4bb8db

> Based on this law, engineers that work on badly designed systems will particularly suffer since **_badly designed systems have unbounded complexity_**.
