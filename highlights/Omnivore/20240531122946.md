## Highlights

> On the other, when Google Original Flavor clearly gets things wrong, it isn’t on the hook. It is not itself asseverating\*\* to the correctness of the sources that it links - instead it is merely indexing the knowledge provided by other people, for whom Google itself takes no responsibility.
> 
> That sweet deal is not available to New Google. The new approach isn’t just linking to other people’s stuff. It’s presenting what appears, to ordinary users, to be Google’s own summarization of the best state of knowledge on a particular topic. People may still often continue to treat this as inerrant. But when there are obvious, ridiculous mistakes, they are likely to treat Google as directly responsible for these mistakes. Google has, effectively, put its own name to them.
