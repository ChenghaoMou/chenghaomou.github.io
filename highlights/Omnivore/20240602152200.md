## Highlights

> A prompt typically starts simple: A few sentences of instruction, a couple of examples, and we’re good to go. But as we try to improve performance and handle more edge cases, complexity creeps in. More instructions. Multi-step reasoning. Dozens of examples. Before we know it, our initially simple prompt is now a 2,000 token frankenstein. And to add injury to insult, it has worse performance on the more common and straightforward inputs! GoDaddy shared this challenge as their [No. 1 lesson from building with LLMs](https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/llm-from-the-trenches-10-lessons-learned-operationalizing-models-at-godaddy#h-1-sometimes-one-prompt-isn-t-enough).

> A promising approach is to have agent systems that produce deterministic plans which are then executed in a structured, reproducible way. In the first step, given a high-level goal or prompt, the agent generates a plan. Then, the plan is executed deterministically. This allows each step to be more predictable and reliable. Benefits include: - Generated plans can serve as few-shot samples to prompt or finetune an agent. - Deterministic execution makes the system more reliable, and thus easier to test and debug. Furthermore, failures can be traced to the specific steps in the plan. - Generated plans can be represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) which are easier, relative to a static prompt, to understand and adapt to new situations.
