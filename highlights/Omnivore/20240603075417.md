## Highlights

> It had simply not occurred to me—and now that it _has_ occurred to me, I definitely do not want small talk and relationships outsourced to server farms. This stuff shouldn’t feel hard or taxing; it’s what our presence here on Earth is mostly made up of. The effort, the clumsiness, and the time invested are where humanity is stored.

> Years from now, could an AI that was trained on all of my friend’s emails and texts and personal documents sound convincingly like them? Could it be so advanced that I wouldn’t even be able to tell that my friend hadn’t written to me at all? Possibly. And that idea saddens me the most.
