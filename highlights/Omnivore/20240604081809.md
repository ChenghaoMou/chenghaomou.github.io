## Highlights

> So we think that the problem can be greatly mitigated by a culture change where researchers systematically exercise more care in their work and reproducibility studies are incentivized. The ML _methods_ community has already moved in this direction via the [common task method](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/event/reproducible-research-and-the-common-task-method/) (which is decades old) and the [reproducibility challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12206) (which is more recent), but this has not yet happened in ML-based science, that is, in disciplines like medicine or psychology that use ML models to advance knowledge in their respective fields.

> AI is not a revolution. It is not a replacement for human understanding — to think so is to miss the point of science. AI does not offer a shortcut to the hard work and frustration inherent to research. AI is not an oracle and cannot see the future.
