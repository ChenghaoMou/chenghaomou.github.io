## Highlights

> One million Blackwell GPUs would suck down an astonishing 1.875 gigawatts of power. For context, a typical nuclear power plant only produces 1 gigawatt of power. 
> 
> Fossil fuel-burning plants, whether that's natural gas, coal, or oil, produce even less. There's no way to ramp up nuclear capacity in the time it will take to supply these millions of chips, so much, if not all, of that extra power demand is going to come from carbon-emitting sources.
> 
> I always feared that the AI data center boom was likely going to make the looming climate catastrophe inevitable, but there was something about seeing it all presented on a platter with a smile and an excited presentation that struck me as more than just tone-deaf. It was damn near revolting. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/i-watched-nvidia-s-computex-2024-keynote-and-it-made-my-blood-ru-18fe259c575#6f0f7b0c-fe3e-46cc-aeab-a05bda4496fd)  ^6f0f7b0c

> When the [Himalayan mountains lose the last of their glaciers](https://apnews.com/article/himalayan-glaciers-climate-change-melting-85cf414573ed8a9fbde4cb56ecf4fdd7), as they are on course to do in the next hundred or so years, the drinking water for an entire subcontinent of nearly two billion people disappears. All of these people will have to leave their homes if they're lucky enough to be able to do so, or die of thirst. An entire civilization will be uprooted, with all its history, landmarks, holy places, and more left behind in what will eventually become a desert.
> 
> Those people's lives matter. They have worth. Their history, culture, and way of life matter. It's not unfortunate but inevitable what's happening to them. It's an active choice by men (they are almost always, 99% of the time, men) who simply close their eyes to the consequences of their choices — if they even look at them at all.

> I think the worst part of Huang's keynote wasn't that none of this mattered, it's that I don't think anyone in Huang's position is really thinking about any of this at all. I hope they're not, which at least means it's possible they can be convinced to change course. The alternative is that they do not care, which is a far darker problem for the world.
