## Highlights

> So in other words, we've got a set up where students are sharing more with an automated system than they'd feel comfortable sharing with a person; the extent to which their interactions are preserved (and subjected to automated analysis) is almost certainly not adequately conveyed; and the company's position on the question of how might this impact student admissions is that we should rely on admissions officers to follow the law. First off, that assumes that all relevant cases are covered under the laws alluded to. Secondly, the best way to ensure that things you're not allowed to consider don't impact decisions is to avoid (to the extent possible) gathering that information in the first place--and lulling students into sharing more than they otherwise would is the opposite of that.
