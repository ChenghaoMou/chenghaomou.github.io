## Highlights

> We find that data quality is essential to model success, so we utilize a hybrid data strategy in our training pipeline, incorporating both human-annotated and synthetic data, and conduct thorough data curation and filtering procedures. We have developed two novel algorithms in post-training: (1) a **rejection sampling fine-tuning algorithm with teacher committee**, and (2) a reinforcement learning from human feedback **(RLHF) algorithm with mirror descent policy optimization** and a **leave-one-out advantage estimator**. We find that these two algorithms lead to significant improvement in the model’s instruction-following quality.
