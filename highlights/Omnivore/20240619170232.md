## Highlights

> Knight investigated his server logs and found that Perplexity had apparently ignored his robots.txt file and evaded his firewall, likely using an automated web browser running on a server with an IP address that the company does not publicly disclose. "I can't even block their IP ranges because it appears these headless browsers are not [on their IP ranges](https://www.perplexity.ai/perplexitybot.json)," he wrote.
> 
> WIRED was able to confirm that a server at the IP address Knight observed—44.221.181.252—will, on demand, visit and download webpages when a user asks Perplexity about the webpage, regardless of what the site’s robots.txt says. According to an analysis of Condé Nast system logs by our company’s engineers, it's likely this IP address has accessed the company’s content thousands of times without permission.
