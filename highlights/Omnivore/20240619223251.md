## Highlights

> The number of companies launching AI initiatives far outstripped the number of _actual_ use cases. Most of the market was simply grifters and incompetents (sometimes both!) leveraging the hype to inflate their headcount so they could get promoted, or be seen as thought leaders[1](#fn:1).

> _Look at us_, resplendent in our pauper's robes, stitched from corpulent greed and breathless credulity, spending half of the planet's engineering efforts to add chatbot support to every application under the sun when half of the industry hasn't worked out how to test database backups regularly.

> Everyone is talking about Retrieval Augmented Generation, but most companies don't actually _have_ any internal documentation worth retrieving.
