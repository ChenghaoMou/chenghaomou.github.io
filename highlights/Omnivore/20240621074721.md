## Highlights

> but also its prosody—how syllables at the start or end of words are stressed and how pauses are used between phrases. Without any awareness of such knowledge, we use it effortlessly both when speaking and when listening; we use it to identify words as they appear within the continuous stream of sound we hear, just as if the words had been written down interspersed with spaces.

> This explained that infants use “transitional probabilities” (TPs) between syllables to identify which syllable strings recurrently go together, and hence are likely to constitute words, and which syllables have low probabilities of following each other and hence are likely to mark the break between words. The phrase _pretty baby,_ for instance, has four syllables (_pre-ty-ba-by_) and three transitional probabilities between syllable pairs. In English the probability that _ty_ will be followed by _ba_ is lower than _pre_ will be followed by _ty,_ and that _ba_ will be followed by _by_. That eight-month-old-infants can calculate and use such transitional probabilities came as a surprise.
