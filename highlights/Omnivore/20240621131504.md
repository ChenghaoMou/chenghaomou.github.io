## Highlights

> This code might be fine for early-stage prototypes. But **for production usage, every component must be reasonably understood** so it won’t blow up on you unexpectedly under real-world usage conditions. You have to adhere to the given data structures and design your application around those abstractions.

> LangChain tries to make your life easier by doing more with less code by **hiding details away from you**. But when this comes at the cost of simplicity and flexibility, ‌abstractions lose their value.
> 
> LangChain also has a habit of using **abstractions on top of other abstractions**, so you’re often forced to think in terms of nested abstractions to understand how to use an API correctly. This inevitably leads to comprehending huge stack traces and debugging internal framework code you didn’t write instead of implementing new features.

> LangChain’s long list of components gives the impression that building an LLM-powered application is complicated. But the core components most applications will need are typically:
> 
> * A client for LLM communication
> * Functions/Tools for function calling
> * A vector database for RAG
> * An Observability platform for tracing, evaluation etc.
> 
> The rest are either helpers around those components (e.g. chunking and embeddings for vector databases), or regular application tasks such as managing files and application state through data persistence and caching.
> 
> If you start your AI development journey without a framework, yes, it will take longer to put your own toolbox together and require more upfront learning and research. But this is time well spent and a worthy investment in you and your application’s future, since you are learning fundamentals in the field you are going to operate.
