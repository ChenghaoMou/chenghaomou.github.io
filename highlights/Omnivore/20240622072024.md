## Highlights

> So instead, the researchers focus on what they call semantic entropy. This evaluates all the statistically likely answers evaluated by the LLM and determines how many of them are semantically equivalent. If a large number all have the same meaning, then the LLM is likely uncertain about phrasing but has the right answer. If not, then it is presumably in a situation where it would be prone to confabulation and should be prevented from doing so.

> Our method works by sampling several possible answers to each question and clustering them algorithmically into answers that have similar meanings, which we determine on the basis of whether answers in the same cluster entail each other bidirectionally. That is, if sentence A entails that sentence B is true and vice versa, then we consider them to be in the same semantic cluster.

> If a single cluster predominates, then the AI is selecting an answer from within one collection of options that has a similar factual content. If there are multiple clusters, then the AI is selecting among different collections that all have different factual content—a situation that's likely to result in confabulation.
