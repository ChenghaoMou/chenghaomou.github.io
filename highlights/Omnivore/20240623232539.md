## Highlights

> “ShotSpotter claims to be ‘a proven detection system’ that is ‘faster and more accurate’, but our audit found that 87 percent of the time, ShotSpotter is sending NYPD officers in response to loud noises that don’t turn out to be confirmed shootings,” said **Comptroller Brad Lander**. “The evidence shows that NYPD is wasting precious time and money on this technology and needs to do a better job managing its resources. Chasing down car backfires and construction noise does not make us safer.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-comptroller-nyc-gov-newsroom-nypds-shotspotter-gunshot-det-1904734767c#c8a476da-876e-4a26-8da2-3b2cc13ed389) ^c8a476da
