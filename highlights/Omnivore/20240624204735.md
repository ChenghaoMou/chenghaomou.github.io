## Highlights

> The record labels claim that neither AI music generator will say which music it has trained its models on, but said that in pre litigation communications, both companies claimed that their training on copyrighted material is “fair use.” The record labels are also suing a series of “John Does,” who they claim are the specific people who helped the companies scrape the music. 
> 
> The lawsuits set up a major court battle about the nature of generative AI services that recreate not just music but also art, video, and text.
