## Highlights

> “There was a period of time where companies were quite concerned that their content moderation decisions would have consequences. But those consequences have not materialized. X shows that the PR loss leading to advertisers fleeing is temporary,” Citron added. “It’s an experiment. It’s like ‘What happens when you don’t have content moderation?’ If the answer is, ‘You have a little bit of a backlash, but it’s temporary and it all comes back,’ well, you know what the answer is? You don’t have to do anything. 100 percent.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/has-facebook-stopped-trying-1904bca3cba#caeedb27-b017-49e3-9462-634442970eb8)  ^caeedb27
