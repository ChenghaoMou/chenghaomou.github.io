## Highlights
> Technology is a multiplier of both good and bad. More technology means better good times, but it also means badder bad times. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=72))

> And the scary thing is, if the good and bad keep exponentially growing, it doesn’t matter how great the good times become. If the bad gets to a certain level of bad, it’s all over for us. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=77))

> Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.1 ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=96))

> This kind of internal disagreement pops up in many parts of life, like a constant tug-of-war in our heads—a tug-of-war over our thoughts, our emotions, our values, our morals, our judgments, and our overall consciousness.

> Plato wrote about a “charioteer” (intellect) that managed the “horses” of rational modesty and passionate insolence. Sigmund Freud’s structure consisted of the “id” (primitive instinct), the “superego” (the conscience), and the “ego” that balances the two with external reality. More recently, social psychologist Daniel Kahneman wrote about “System 1” (fast, involuntary thinking) and “System 2” (slow, complex thinking that requires effort). Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote about the emotional “elephant” and its rational “rider” which appears to be in control but often is not. Harvard’s Todd Rogers and Max H. Bazerman wrote about the conflict between the “want self” and the “should self.” ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=211))

> For most beliefs, we’re so concerned with where people stand that we often forget the most important thing about what someone thinks: how they arrived at what they think. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=250))

> Trust, when assigned wisely, is an efficient knowledge-acquisition trick. If you can trust a person who actually speaks the truth, you can take the knowledge that person worked hard for—either through primary research or indirectly, using their own diligent trust criteria—and “photocopy” it into your own brain. This magical intellectual corner-cutting tool has allowed humanity to accumulate so much collective knowledge over the past 10,000 years that a species of primates can now understand the origins of the universe.
