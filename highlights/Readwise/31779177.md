# Putting Ideas Into Words

## Highlights
> Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but incomplete too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h994829dacaayepfwmmnyymk))

> The real test is reading what you've written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing of what's in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you wrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make an effort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger, and when you do the news is usually bad.

> What I'm saying is that however much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you'll still learn new things from writing about them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h994bp4ptkm6hjz0y1v91jyg))

> Ideas can feel complete. It's only when you try to put them into words that you discover they're not. So if you never subject your ideas to that test, you'll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never realize it.
