## Highlights
> Build your wealth upon your career.You most likely will make far more money from your business or profession than from your investments. Only very rarely does someone make a large fortune from investments. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jk9z7q55kgxwf3bsw8xdsg))

> The fact that you earned what you have doesn’t mean that you could earn it again if you lost it. Markets and opportunities change, technology changes, laws change. Conditions today may be considerably different from what they were when you built the estate you have now. And as time passes, increasing regulation makes it harder and harder to amass a fortune. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkbe344wy0st35z7t61f77))

> Investor advisors have no more ability to predict the future actions of human beings than psychics and fortune-tellers do. And so events never unfold as we were so sure they would. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkd8arkbw0gfchh14kz2jh))

> The investment expert with the perfect record up to now will lose his touch as soon as you start acting on his advice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkep92znztk0db0rke2etq))

> The second source is probably finding something that has worked in the past and assuming it will work in the future. Trading systems are based on the unstated assumption that the world doesn’t change. But the world is in constant change – as desires change, demand changes, and supplies change. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkge82321c1apmzz1sp4hz))

> But, most of all, no advisor can be expected to treat your money with the same respect you do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkh796k53h1bvwbbcgga4f))

> Don’t undertake any investment, speculation, or investment program that you don’t understand. If you do, you may later discover risks you weren’t aware of. Or your losses might turn out to be greater than the amount you invested. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkhmv96xna40kwwbvp7ztx))

> Every investment has its time in the sun — and its moment of shame. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkj5t9pzx5tkv52brz2014))

> And you can’t rely on any single institution to protect your wealth for you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkjeqzwm7w498a9qv83cft))

> You shouldn’t risk the chance that a single surprise will wipe out a large part of your holdings.
> Diversify across investments and institutions – and keep things simple enough to manage yourself – you can relax, knowing that no one event can do you in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkjv9a1s7kfz1a2hj6pmwt))

> For the money you need to take care of you for the rest of your life, set up a simple, balanced, diversified portfolio. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkkg7ap157w3wzqs1tv2bz))

> If you want to try to beat the market, set up a second — separate — portfolio with which you can speculate to your heart’s content. But make sure this portfolio contains no more of your wealth than you can afford to lose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkngvt3gfbre7bs1eqm1za))

> Don’t allow everything you own to be where your government can touch it. By having something outside the reach of your government, you’ll be less vulnerable — and you’ll feel less vulnerable. You’ll no longer have to worry so much about what the government will do next. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jknzzmegkjp2hag38g2fen))

> Whenever you’re in doubt about a course of action, it is always better to err on the side of safety. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jkra09p774dnnj00068j1z))---
