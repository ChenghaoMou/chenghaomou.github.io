## Highlights
> Peer review, when it is working well, doesn’t guarantee truth or correctness, but it does mean: This was examined critically and thoughtfully by 2–4 independent people with relevant knowledge who found it sufficiently solid (given their own knowledge) and worthy of others’ attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p194158eg61pvz79cb2775))

> When we serve as reviewers, we are charged with critical analysis of the work. When we are looking for work to build on, we are frequently much less critical, and end up seeking out papers that say what we want to hear. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p19f033qzb423rdgthqw9e))

> In other words, when a paper has passed peer review but won’t appear for a while, posting a preprint gives access to other scholars and the broad public without further delay. (And if the publication venue is paywalled, it also circumvents the paywall.) For all I know, this is what arXiv was originally meant for or even how it’s used in other fields. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p1bseaxjy9pf22x2ngxvkp))

> Another way of putting this is: if you’re doing work that you’re worried will get scooped, you’re probably not asking very interesting or original questions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p1dfx67vrbygnnry02yjef))

> *Eroding the value of peer review:* When arXiv becomes such a center of gravity that even published papers are also put on arXiv for attention, and when everyone just cites arXiv versions of papers without checking if they have appeared somewhere with peer review, then we lose the value of the (expensive yet important) peer review process. The point of peer review *is* gatekeeping (of *papers*, not *authors*, obviously): so that someone coming from outside can find papers that have been critically appraised by knowledgeable peers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p1e3xy20b7xc49t7rmrzjy))

> These also have knock-on effects: the flag-planting culture leads to ever more pressure to “move fast”, impeding our ability to engage in slow scholarship. It also means that everyone’s attention is focused only on the latest papers, thinning the fabric of the scholarly conversation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p1ef9ag2ht6fjbt6w5gdvs))

> The erosion of the value of peer review also allows what are effectively fraudulent citation rings (equivalent of fraudulent review rings) to hide in plain sight. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p1emnknem4ycvgnkhv9dz3))

> I noted above that people who are accessing papers in the course of their research are often looking for papers that say what they want to hear. And what is ChatGPT designed for if not outputting exactly what we want to hear? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p1gbqf9x85nj39jd8w2eet))
