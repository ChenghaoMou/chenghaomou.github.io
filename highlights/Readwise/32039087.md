# Minimalism Is Getting Absurd: Updating Dieter Rams' 10 Principles

## Highlights
> I mean sure the brown calculator is probably functionally better because of its good design it's probably made a little bit better but it's not 10 times better you're paying 10 times more for the emotional response that this object creates in you this isn't just a calculator anymore either it's a symbol of Purity and Order plus the brown calculator is a design icon which is also totally emotional and sentimental none of that value is grounded in any
> kind of objective truth it's still just a plastic calculator so is it the design dishonest and how it creates a meaning beyond the sum of its parts or is it dishonest with how expensive it is ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z6cw7em9tj54a2t88bc01n))

> dishonest or not it's still a great design as long as people value things Beyond just their functional utility this will always be the case ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z6d6dvacx3t5rrwe9pts5p))

> when a product loses too many of its controls the remaining ones are left to pick up the slack so you have two buttons that do like 10 things holding down tapping performing a finger ritual dance you've traded intuitive interaction for a device that needs an instruction manual or chairs that are too uncomfortable to actually sit in for more than 10 minutes or computers that are missing headphone
> jacks or functional ports the true purpose of minimalism was to ease user experience by limiting options but instead it's mostly used as an aesthetic statement so you end up with visual Simplicity that's a functional nightmare ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z6j5rzdsd83w1g0skdypcf))

> then you've got Johnny ive's 65 000 turntable it's a blatant symbol of desire and opulent statement piece but that was
> never the point of the Bauhaus or minimalist movements they're aimed to create simple useful designs that are accessible to everyone one it was Beauty born out of purpose and uncompromised by mass production but somehow we've worked this ideology focusing on The Superficial aesthetic while neglecting the core principles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z6m46655f1bsnq5y410dqs))

> the real problem here is with the
> unquestioning idolization of Dita ROMs and its principles while not understanding their true meaning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z6msbyyhjmefttbpbpvg3q))

> fewer elements means that every detail is under a spotlight so ensuring these details are perfect can drive up production costs in this way the pursuit of minimalism can ironically lead to
> exclusivity rather than the intended goal of universal accessibility ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z6nk2zr16t8ctwxghafqnz))

> I think that a lot of times this as little design as possible idea is used as an excuse to make emotionless design that's cold and oversimplified and not in line with what the customer needs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z6qxp4wrgjc9azhmj616v6))

> even the most logical design without emotional resonance will fall flat Form and Function are one and the same a product appearance guides our interaction with it and sometimes you need a little bit of the embellishment or Flair ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z6tj8456e4q2qeqarf339z))

> it's like applying a Band-Aid to a blister caused by poorly fitting shoes sure the Band-Aid might help the pain for a little while but the real problem is with the poorly fitting shoes in the same way Eco efficiency is the Band-Aid that fails to tackle the root cause our Reliance on unsustainable resources ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z6ymt4bv2wnta8hxw59s58))

> Eco efficiency is about doing less harm whereas Eco Effectiveness is about doing more good it's about regenerative processes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z6zgdb64n7jwmvfwjbe6b2))

> lots of things are specifically designed with a learning curve in mind because half the fun comes from navigating learning and mastering the product over time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z77cpbg930mfgbt090vwxj))

> good design bows to the fundamental principles of life it's never just about out the product it's about the all-encompassing system it must respect all people the designers Engineers Factory workers end users and of course the most important user Mother Earth ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9z7efeswp9gckktyrkp9zah))
