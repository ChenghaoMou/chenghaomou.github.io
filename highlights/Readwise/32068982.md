## Highlights
> It’s a shame more entrepreneurs don’t talk about their most difficult moments publicly, because it paints a distorted picture of what startups are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha1jxxb8b6av094921p6h91a))

> I should have had conversations with my co-founders about what rules they were comfortable breaking. Testing product demand with a fake landing page that collects credit card information? Manufacturing a sense of urgency when fundraising? Pushing the limits of the law, which we never did, but which many innovative companies such as Airbnb and Lyft are doing? If we had these conversations early on, we could have avoided culture clashes (and worse) later on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha1k553tgqrcj3vvyq9es9bv))

> First and foremost, I’ve come to realize that “technically true” is a terrible ethical measure for a (non-technical) statement. I should have held myself to a higher standard. I’ve also learned the importance of overwhelming honesty. The phrase is borrowed from the excellent book [The Transparency Edge](https://web.archive.org/web/20140803073308/http://smile.amazon.com/The-Transparency-Edge-Elizabeth-Pagano/dp/0071458840/) (worth a read in full).

> In the same way a product builds up technical debt with every piece of hacky code, a leader can build up a sort of managerial debt with every fib, embellishment, and exaggeration. They all serve to undermine credibility. And without credibility, you cannot lead. Moving forward, overwhelming honesty is the name of the game at Amicus.
