## Highlights
> Executive Function Theft (EFT) is the deliberate abdication of decision-making, tasks, and responsibilities that are perceived as administrative or repetitive, of lesser importance, or aren’t pleasant or shiny, to another person, with the result that the receiving person’s executive function becomes so exhausted that they are unable to participate in, contribute to, or enjoy higher level efforts.

> The goal, in the name of the company bottom dollar, is to make it as inconvenient as possible for me to use an employer offered benefit. A truly mundane and recurrent example, unfortunately, as I try to navigate U.S. health insurance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01had44ezqpsqdghvd1pbf7qvx))

> Similarly thinking about EFT in the workplace, I was reminded of the guy who got famous with the Four Hour Workweek book and how we were all just supposed to outsource things to nameless underpaid gig workers. Notably, when looking for a summary of that book, I found an article by Cal Newport praising it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01had4994dgyx4241b8ej2zccc))

> Executive Function Theft can lead to an inequality of time to dream, to rest, or to plan and grow professionally. If you are facing EFT in the workplace, how are you supposed to do five year goals or strategic planning?

> “While his female partner continues to do housework for twenty, twenty-six, thirty-one more hours — he can devote this time to hobbies, relaxation, exercise, hanging out with friends, sleep, work and/or continued education. Essentially, he has the opportunity to do so much more with his life than she does.” — Kate Mangino, Equal Partners, Chapter 1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01had4cxkvbh9s3saapd70d67k))

> I don’t think you can have a conversation about Executive Function Theft without also talking about the mental load and invisible labor and emotional labor. All of these concepts are connected. EFT creates a greater mental load for another individual. EFT demands ever increasing amounts of invisible labor without giving equitable time for “promotable tasks” or rest. EFT expects that Someone Else who they have assigned to be of lesser importance will take on the emotional parts of work or care tasks.
