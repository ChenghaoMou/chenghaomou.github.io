> Reading is not a luxury. It’s not something you splurge on. It’s a necessity. Even if all you get is one life-changing idea from a book, that’s still a pretty good ROI. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haf03n28y8yk2gx8wxhq7hv3))

If I don’t, if I only want a surface take, why read a book at all? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haf0a0646spg6b2k69gzsfth))
