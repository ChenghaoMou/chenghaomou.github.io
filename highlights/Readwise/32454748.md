# Workshop on Responsible and Open Foundation Models

## Highlights
> by sharing this with as broad a community as possible we accelerate the development and the quality of the work and that's really my
> core hypothesis in in pursuing this it really comes down to the fact that when you open up the doors to this technology to much more large and diverse Community you really accelerate your ability to make progress not just on the technical components on the usability components as well as some of the other aspects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb11p6984zk5vk5erqx56md5))

> so I would say in many ways what's been important in our organization to be able to do so much work in in openly is to spend time being thoughtful about that culture and to be thoughtful about how do we set the conditions for the work to be successful ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb121rmya3mp554nxjj89js1))

> one of the key elements of that culture that has been really important is this one it's pretty simple we start every project with the intent to open source the work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb122kryfakpps2msh683e7h))

> I think red teaming and other techniques of auditing have historically been ways in which we can provide better public understanding of limitations they don't necessarily in and of themselves translate into responsible development because they are not necessarily fully integrated into the development pipeline ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1c8nxnc2850x970wbckjdj))

> there are times where you have technology systems um that are kind of poorly constructed from a responsibility standpoint and a governance standpoint because there's no
> real owner of like who's accountable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1d60024k6mn8va8satn5ha))

> I think the right way to think about llms is that they are virtual machines um and tokens are their machine code basically I think we often think about llms as sort of information processing entities or even as chat Bots fundamentally but but they're not they are they are systems that have a state associated with them tokens change their
> state and if they in their outputs can cause real effects if you start tying these things to uh invoice payments or emails or even more things like automated control of of large systems this I think genuinely gets a bit a bit concerning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1g0940f0qaw3nzb89xc84r))

> but I think that by setting strong Community Norms around acceptable and unacceptable uses especially in places that are you know like like um like Hugging Facebook Luther area that are our community hubs and places where people come together to talk about technology you can have a a really strong mitigating effect on a lot of these things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb6xspznvrefmzd2svb48m6d))
