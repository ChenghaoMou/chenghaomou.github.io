## Highlights
> It’s exactly because of these grey areas that **I whole-heartedly support the authors' conclusion**: "open" is not a magic bullet to the heart of power. We should all scream from the mountaintops that "open" can centralize power, either unintentionally or as an explicit strategic goal. They are also correct that we need to be particularly concerned about the relationship of open and power at a time when the means of technological production are firmly centralized. In other words: we can't just say "open is good"—at least along the dimension of societal and industrial power, open can and will be used and abused by those who seek to control the rest of us.
