# Buy wisely

## Highlights
> *Cost per use* accounts for longevity. Durable and repairable things may cost more upfront, but over time they cost less than things that break and need to be replaced. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbttdbs3fe7dj4p5knrtz5fe))

> These are some of the questions I ask of the things that I incorporate into my life:
> • Will it be as useful to me in the future as it is now?
> • Is it made of durable and maintainable materials?
> • Does it have a timeless style and aesthetic?
> • Does it age well, wear well, build a wabi-sabi patina?
> • Does it retain its resale value? Would someone else want to own it?
> • Can it be disassembled and repaired?
> • Does it have replaceable, non-proprietary parts that are easy to acquire?
> • Can it be powered with a standard plug or replaceable batteries?
> • Can it be modified and upgraded?
> • Has the maker existed for at least as long as I hope to keep the product?
> • Can it perform many jobs, or only one?
> • Does it have a guarantee?
> • Does it rely on other products or technologies that aren't durable? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtthvar2m3scwn0w9zm2t0m))

> There is an opportunity cost to every dollar. A dollar you spend on a something that won't get much use is a dollar you can't save for something that will. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbttk0k7r5an1whgt3a2jxvk))

> Some things have excellent cost per use but few *smiles per use*. I don't smile every time I put my nice socks on. A few years ago I bought a fairly expensive electric road bike. It probably didn't have the best *cost per use*, but it gives me the most *joy per use* of any product I purchased in recent memory. It's worth it to me.

> Some purchases may have externalities that are incompatible with your values. For example, you may wish to buy organic produce, pasture-raised eggs, or fair trade coffee. You may wish to buy products that preserve privacy, reduce environmental impact, or support a cause you believe in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbttnff4zmntkpgcqm3cxxbs))
