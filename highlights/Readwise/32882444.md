## Highlights
> The whole point of models is to be able to use them downstream for other purposes, e,g, in robotics, navigation, computer graphics, and so on. Models that can’t be used downstream are scarcely worthy of the name, and are in no position to solve the reliability problems that plague current AI.

> Yes, Google Search accounting might sometimes get things right, because the ways that people use language on the web correlates to some degree the world. But doesn’t mean you can rely on the variable *number of Google hits* as a physical model of the world. It will work for some things but not others. If you want trustworthy AI, this ain’t it.

> It’s the same problem: correlations are fragile, and you can’t count on them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc11bmmm1w24mv8fnc332vxt))

> Without flexible underlying models that can reliably support inferences on novel questions, we can expect more of the same of what we are seeing over and over now: more hallucinations, more reasoning that is hit or miss, and nothing like the stability we should insist on for future AI.
