## Highlights
> Scientists are incentivized to, and often do, **withhold as much information as possible** about their innovations in their publications to maintain a monopoly over future innovations. This slows the overall progress of science. 
> For example, a chemist who synthesizes a new molecule will publish that they have done so in order to be rewarded for their work with a publication. But in the publication they will describe their synthesis method in as minimal detail as they can while still making it through peer review. This forces other scientists to invest time and effort to reproduce their work, giving them a head-start in developing the next, better synthesis.

> Many published papers have methodical or statistical errors, are derivative and don't add anything to the discourse, are misleading or obfuscated, sometimes even fraudulent or were just bad research to begin with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heka78xyrz7q7f795gax0fre))

> Research contexts are so multiplicitous that every compiled report or visualization has huge amounts of noise and no user interface ever can be expressive enough to perfectly parameterize that context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hekacstb76yjhtc2ra5m87gc))

> What’s the value of getting a topic hierarchy, causal diagram or paper recommendations? It has some value if the user does not already have an operational model in his head but how often is that the case? Most biotech research jobs require a PhD level schema from the get go, so what’s the added value to a noisy AI-generated one?
