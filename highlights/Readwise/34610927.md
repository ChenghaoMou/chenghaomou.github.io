## Highlights
> **Why do we complain?**
> It’s an ego boost.
> When you complain about someone or something else being bad, negative, annoying, etc., you’re implicitly saying you’re good, smart, better, etc. And that feels good. At least in the moment.
> In other words, chronic complaining or criticizing is usually a sign of low self-esteem: You feel bad about yourself and have gotten in the habit of using complaining as a way to temporarily inflate your ego and feel good about yourself.
> Of course, it’s a pretty flimsy strategy, which is why in the long run it only hurts your self-esteem and leads to feeling guilty and ashamed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hg6nvdkhategyg9frf9245fk))
