## Highlights
> The cat is out of the bag:
> • Generative AI systems like DALL-E and ChatGPT have been trained on copyrighted materials;
> • OpenAI, despite its name, has not been transparent about what it has been trained on.
> • Generative AI systems are fully capable of producing materials that infringe on copyright.
> • They do not inform users when they do so.
> • They do not provide any information about the provenance of any of the images they produce.
> • Users may not know when they produce any given image whether they are infringing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjw1ftbsx2mrnv77w72js020))
