## Highlights
> In a very simple but effective example of tracking, James Clear, author of [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break-ebook/dp/B07D23CFGR?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.aXsBtnMkwKSNQViJPCubNzHyMrAjSl8X3iHJ-0rQD4xrmRSNM92yHXRyU0JQSCAgj0zTzk9ujUyA-oGcl4ipPZhCXRoXTRQKDIubh9hHc5sMxU8opekwATZTFuf1leBcXq9rOV9u3L5C4bb4BGo6MA.k5eB9tdOhoVw5uxV914znKs_txed78yQU80sqvDtZBw&qid=1705171380&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mmamzn06-20&linkId=73918a1d08210361f93d6f3a97aa27c4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), shared the story of Zach on his email newsletter, who carried a notecard around to jot down the following every time he engaged in problematic behavior:
