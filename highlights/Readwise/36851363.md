# 3-2-1: On Endless Pursuits, the Value of Courage, and How to Buy Back Your Time

## Highlights
> Ethnobotanist and mystic **Terence McKenna** on courage:
> "Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmk4vtsay3pm0py611w8vzde))
