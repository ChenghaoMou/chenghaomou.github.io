> 404 Media’s own testing found that generally, the workarounds were effective, however.

This is a problem with moderating AI image generators using keywords: people can easily find ways to write around banned words, as we saw when [people recently made Spongebob do 9/11](https://www.404media.co/bing-is-generating-images-of-spongebob-doing-9-11/) despite being forbidden by Bing’s terms of use.
