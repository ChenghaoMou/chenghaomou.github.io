## Highlights
> That's four reasons: for AI hype:
> I. to win investors and customers;
> II. to cover customers' and users' embarrassment when the AI doesn't perform;
> III. AI dreamers so high on their own supply that they can't tell truth from fantasy;
> IV. A business-model for doomsayers who form an unholy alliance with AI companies by parroting their silliest hype in warning form.
> But there's a fifth motivation for criti-hype: to simplify otherwise tedious and complex situations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnawk1vxdf379q06t1te1wya))---
