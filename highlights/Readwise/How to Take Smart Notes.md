## Highlights
<mark>Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.</mark> ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=134))

<mark>There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.</mark> ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=139))

<mark>They struggle because they believe, as they are made to believe, that writing starts with a blank page.</mark> ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=153))

<mark>The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.</mark> ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=158))

<mark>What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004).</mark> ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=166))

<mark>Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests.</mark> ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=179))

<mark>A good, structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time.</mark> ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=200))

<mark>To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement – which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception.</mark> ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=203))

<mark>The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery – or insight.</mark> ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=208))

<mark>Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.</mark> ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=213))

<mark>All that means is that a system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information, which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim of generating new ideas.</mark> ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=224))

<mark>In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations – as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison. That means that those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities.</mark> ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=228))

<mark>This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994).</mark> ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=236))

<mark>The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level.</mark> ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=251))

<mark>It is not about redoing what you have done before, but about changing the way of working from now on.</mark> ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=257))

<mark>There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have. Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway.</mark> ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=257))

<mark>Like every change in behaviour, a change in working habits means going through a phase where you are drawn back to your old ways.</mark> ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=266))

<mark>The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture.</mark> ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=274))

<mark>All the little steps must be linked in a way that will enable you to go seamlessly from one task to another, but still be kept separate enough to enable us to flexibly do what needs to be done in any given situation.</mark> ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=300))

<mark>Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.</mark> ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=302))

<mark>one note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarily the context it was taken from.</mark> ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=319))

<mark>It is in the nature of writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that questions change, the material we work with turns out to be very different from the one imagined or that new ideas emerge, which might change our whole perspective on what we do.</mark> ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=375))

<mark>Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998).</mark> ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=381))

<mark>This is not just about having the right mindset, it is also about having the right workflow.</mark> ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=384))

<mark>It is about having the right tools and knowing how to use them – and very few understand that you need both.</mark> ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=386))

<mark>The main misunderstanding stems from an isolated focus on the slip-box and a neglect of the actual workflow in which it is embedded.</mark> ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=397))

<mark>Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means.</mark> ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=403))

<mark>Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box.</mark> ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=419))
literature notes

<mark>He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box.</mark> ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=422))

<mark>And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material.</mark> ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=426))

<mark>The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. The numbers bore no meaning and were only there to identify each note permanently. If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note.</mark> ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=435))

<mark>Adding a note directly behind another note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system.</mark> ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=442))

<mark>We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. But first, let me guide you through the process of writing a paper with the slip-box.</mark> ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=457))

<mark>Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done.</mark> ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=485))

<mark>Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is.</mark> ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=491))

<mark>If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head.</mark> ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=496))

<mark>You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write.</mark> ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=502))

<mark>If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense.</mark> ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=503))

<mark>Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind.</mark> ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=511))

<mark>They should not cause any distraction. Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later. I usually have a simple notebook with me, but I am happy with napkins or receipts if nothing else is at hand.</mark> ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=512))

<mark>If your thoughts are already sorted and you have the time, you can skip this step and write your idea directly down as a proper, permanent note for your slip-box.</mark> ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=514))

<mark>Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing.</mark> ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=516))

<mark>Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place – your reference system.</mark> ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=519))

<mark>box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests.</mark> ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=521))

<mark>The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions.</mark> ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=523))

<mark>Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible.</mark> ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=525))

<mark>Look to which note the new one directly relates or, if it does not relate directly to any other note yet, just file it behind the last one.</mark> ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=532))

<mark>Making sure you will be able to find this note later by either linking to it from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point to a discussion or topic and is itself linked to the index.</mark> ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=536))

<mark>See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about.</mark> ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=539))

<mark>Look through the connections and collect all the relevant notes on this topic (most of the relevant notes will already be in partial order), copy them onto your “desktop”[6] and bring them in order. Look for what is missing and what is redundant. Don’t wait until you have everything together. Rather, try ideas out and give yourself enough time to go back to reading and note-taking to improve your ideas, arguments and their structure.</mark> ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=550))

<mark>Turn your notes into a rough draft. Don’t simply copy your notes into a manuscript. Translate them into something coherent and embed them into the context of your argument while you build your argument out of the notes at the same time.</mark> ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=555))

<mark>In reality, you never work on just one idea, but many ideas in different stages at the same time. And that is where the system plays out its real strengths.</mark> ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=560))

<mark>You might read a certain book in hope it could be useful for one of the papers you write. Maybe you are wrong, but it still might contain</mark> ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=563))

<mark>some interesting thoughts worth keeping and useful for something else you haven’t thought about yet.</mark> ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=564))

<mark>Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn.</mark> ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=578))

<mark>Each added bit of information, filtered only by our interest, is a contribution to our future understanding, thinking and writing.</mark> ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=581))

<mark>Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking. The slip-box provides an external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information.</mark> ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=612))

<mark>They only function as a reminder of a thought and are not meant to capture the thought itself, which requires time to phrase proper sentences and check facts.</mark> ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=631))

<mark>They can’t speed up the main part of the work, which is thinking, reading and understanding.</mark> ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=648))

<mark>If we try to use a tool without putting any thought into the way we work with it, even the best tool would not be of much help. The slip-box, for example, would most likely be used as an archive for notes – or worse: a graveyard for thoughts (cf. Hollier 2005, 40 on Mallarmé’s index cards).</mark> ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=670))

<mark>assumption: Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research.</mark> ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=702))

<mark>Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community</mark> ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=704))

<mark>An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all.</mark> ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=705))

<mark>the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter.</mark> ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=710))

<mark>The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, regardless of who the author is or the status of the publisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas.</mark> ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=716))

<mark>If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing.</mark> ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=719))

<mark>Working as if nothing else counts than writing does not mean spending more time writing at the expense of everything else.</mark> ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=721))

<mark>You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don’t understand what it is about.</mark> ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=734))

<mark>And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008).</mark> ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=736))

<mark>Working like this will leave you with a lot of different notes in many different places. Writing, then, means to rely heavily on your brain to remember where and when these notes were written down. A text must then be conceptualised independently from these notes, which explains why so many resort to brainstorming to arrange the resources afterwards according to this preconceived idea.</mark> ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=782))

<mark>In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?</mark> ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=787))

<mark>The slip-box is the shipping container of the academic world. Instead of having different storage for different ideas, everything goes into the same slip-box and is standardised into the same format.</mark> ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=791))

<mark>Even though the slip-box, being organised bottom-up, does not face the trade-off problem between too many or too few topics, it too can lose its value when notes are added to it indiscriminately. It can only play out its strengths when we aim for a critical mass, which depends not only on the number of notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled.</mark> ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=799))

<mark>Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two.</mark> ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=804))

<mark>Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the reference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box.</mark> ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=806))

<mark>Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished.</mark> ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=810))

<mark>The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight.</mark> ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=818))

<mark>The second typical mistake is to collect notes only related to specific projects.</mark> ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=822))

<mark>ups. Just collecting unprocessed fleeting notes inevitably leads to chaos. Even small amounts of unclear and unrelated notes lingering around your desk will soon induce the wish of starting from scratch.</mark> ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=831))

<mark>What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way.</mark> ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=833))

<mark>margins. It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. They will very soon become completely useless – unless you do something with them.</mark> ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=842))

<mark>Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later.</mark> ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=844))

<mark>Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.</mark> ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=848))

<mark>away. That is why the threshold to write an idea down has to be as low as possible, but it is equally crucial to elaborate on them within a day or two.</mark> ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=850))

<mark>A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal.</mark> ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=851))

<mark>The only permanently stored notes are the literature notes in the reference system and the main notes in the slip-box. The former can be very brief as the context is clearly the text they refer to. The latter need be written with more care and details as they need to be self-explanatory.</mark> ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=854))

<mark>The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.</mark> ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=866))

<mark>It doesn’t matter in which format these notes are as they are going to end up in the bin after the project is finished anyway (or in an archive – the bin for the indecisive).</mark> ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=873))

<mark>Project-related notes can be:   ·      comments in the manuscript ·      collections of project-related literature ·      outlines ·      snippets of drafts ·      reminders</mark> ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=877))

<mark>·      to-do lists ·      and of course the draft itself.</mark> ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=887))

<mark>To be able to decide on a topic, one must already have read quite a bit and certainly not just about one topic. And the decision to read something and not something else is obviously rooted in prior understanding, and that didn’t come out of thin air, either.</mark> ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=920))

<mark>It accompanies everything: We have to read with a pen in hand, develop ideas on paper and build up an ever-growing pool of externalised thoughts. We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by our interest, curiosity and intuition, which is formed and informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas – and is something that continuously grows and reflects our knowledge and understanding externally.</mark> ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=929))

<mark>By focusing on what is interesting and keeping written track of your own intellectual development, topics, questions and arguments will emerge from the material without force.</mark> ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=933))

<mark>brainstorming. If you haven’t written along the way, the brain is indeed the only place to turn to. On its own, it is not such a great choice: it is neither objective nor reliable – two quite important aspects in academic or nonfiction writing.</mark> ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=944))

<mark>The advice to think about what to write about before you write comes both too early and too late. Too late, as you already have passed up the chance to build up written resources when you face the white sheet of paper or the blank screen, but also too early, if you try to postpone every serious content-related work until you have made a decision on the topic.</mark> ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=949))

<mark>There is one reliable sign if you managed to structure your workflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about.</mark> ([Location 954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=954))

<mark>Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, or in the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow.</mark> ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1009))

<mark>Having a growth mindset is crucial, but only one side of the equation. Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important.</mark> ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1021))

<mark>Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words.</mark> ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1031))

<mark>The ability to express understanding in one’s own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes – and only by doing it with the chance of realizing our lack of understanding can we become better at it.</mark> ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1036))

<mark>The same applies to the crucial ability to distinguish the important bits of a text from the less important ones:</mark> ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1038))

<mark>Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if we really thought them through. The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, the system will unambiguously show us contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions.</mark> ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1042))

<mark>While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased – a lot (Wang and Tchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009). Not only the quantity but also the quality of their accomplishments lagged significantly behind that of the control group.</mark> ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1095))

<mark>sense. Multitasking is not what we think it is. It is not focusing attention on more than one thing at a time. Nobody can do that. When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again. Trying to multitask fatigues us and decreases our ability to deal with more than one task.</mark> ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1101))

<mark>The second is what psychologists call the mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it – completely independent of our actual performance (Bornstein 1989). We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill.</mark> ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1107))

<mark>Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard.

<mark>It is not a sign of professionalism to master one technique and stick to it no matter what, but to be flexible and adjust one’s reading to whatever speed or approach a text requires.</mark> ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1173))

<mark>it is not a relentless focus, but flexible focus that distinguishes them. “Specifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas.

<mark>The widespread praise for planning rests on the misconception that a process like writing an academic text, which is highly dependent on cognition and thinking, can rely on conscious decision-making alone. But academic writing is an art, as well, which means it is something we can become better at with experience and deliberate practice.</mark> ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1209))

<mark>Things we understand are connected, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations.

<mark>Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance.</mark> ([Location 1297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1297))

<mark>All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of. That’s right: The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note.</mark> ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1300))

<mark>The first step is to break down the amorphous task of “writing” into smaller pieces of different tasks that can be finished in one go. The second step is to make sure we always write down the outcome of our thinking, including possible connections to further inquiries.</mark> ([Location 1308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1308))

<mark>That is one of the main advantages of thinking in writing – everything is externalised anyway.</mark> ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1317))

<mark>cheat. Instead of forcing ourselves to do something we don’t feel like doing, we need to find a way to make us feel like doing what moves our project further along. Doing the work that need to be done without having to apply too much willpower requires a technique, a ruse.</mark> ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1347))

<mark>The outcome of reading with a pen in the hand is not possible to anticipate either, and here, too, the idea is not to copy, but to have a meaningful dialogue with the texts we read.</mark> ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1393))

<mark>This is why we have to translate them into our own language to prepare them to be embedded into new contexts of our own thinking, the different context(s) within the slip-box.</mark> ([Location 1397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1397))

<mark>And what is most helpful is to reflect on the frame, the theoretical background, methodological approach or perspective of the text we read. That often means to reflect as much on what is not mentioned as what is mentioned.</mark> ([Location 1417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1417))

<mark>Here, everything is about building up a critical mass of useful notes in the slip-box, which gives us a clear idea of how to read and how to take literature notes.</mark> ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1426))

<mark>But all of this would be just an extra step before you do the only step that really counts, which is to take the permanent note that will add value to the actual slip-box.</mark> ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1430))

<mark>Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes. Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction.</mark> ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1433))

<mark>While we should seek out dis-confirming arguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking, we are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good, which is everything that confirms what we already believe we know.</mark> ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1457))

<mark>Confirmation bias is tackled here in two steps: First, by turning the whole writing process on its head, and secondly, by changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to an indiscriminate gathering of any relevant information regardless of what argument it will support.</mark> ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1481))

<mark>The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box.</mark> ([Location 1502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1502))

<mark>Yes, we have to be selective, but not in terms of pros and cons, but in terms of relevant or irrelevant. And as soon we focus on the content of the slip-box, dis-confirming data becomes suddenly very attractive, because it opens up more possible connections and discussions within the slip-box, while mere confirming data does not.</mark> ([Location 1509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1509))

<mark>Extracting the gist of a text or an idea and giving an account in writing is for academics what daily practice on the piano is for pianists: The more often we do it and the more focused we are, the more virtuous we become.</mark> ([Location 1526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1526))

<mark>Reading with a pen in your hand is the small-scale equivalent of a lecture.

<mark>The most important advantage of writing is that it helps us to confront ourselves when we do not understand something as well as we would like to believe.</mark> ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1580))

<mark>Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text.

<mark>If we put effort into the attempt of retrieving information, we are much more likely to remember it in the long run, even if we fail to retrieve it without help in the end (Roediger and Karpicke 2006).

<mark>Only in the written form can an argument be looked at with a certain distance – literally.

<mark>What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?</mark> ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1783))

<mark>Just by writing down these questions and making possible connections explicit in writing are the concepts and theories being investigated. Their limitations become as visible as their particular angle on a problem. By explicitly writing down how something connects or leads to something else, we force ourselves to clarify and distinguish ideas from each other.</mark> ([Location 1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1805))

<mark>Writing notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than an attempt to understand the wider meaning of something.

<mark>used. Because it should not be used as an archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as a system to think with, the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note. Focusing exclusively on the index would basically mean that we always know upfront what we are looking for – we would have to have a fully developed plan in our heads. But liberating our brains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use the slip-box in the first place.</mark> ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2003))

<mark>The consideration of how to structure a topic, therefore, belongs on notes as well – and not on a meta-hierarchical level.

TOC note

<mark>The most common form of reference is plain note-to-note links. They have no function other than indicating a relevant connection between two individual notes. By linking two related notes regardless of where they are within the slip-box or within different contexts, surprising new lines of thought can be established.</mark> ([Location 2087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2087))

<mark>It is important to always keep in mind that making these links is not a chore, a kind of file-box maintenance. The search for meaningful connections is a crucial part of the thinking process towards the finished manuscript. But here, it is dealt with in a very concrete way. Instead of figuratively searching our internal memory, we literally go through the file-box and look for connections. By dealing with actual notes, we are also less prone to imagine connections where there aren’t any, as we can see in black and white if something makes sense or not.</mark> ([Location 2099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2099))

<mark>If we try to feed it some lofty ideas, it will force us to check first: What is the reference? How does that connect to the facts and the ideas you already have?</mark> ([Location 2107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2107))

<mark>If we practice learning not as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter a virtuous circle where learning facilitates learning.</mark> ([Location 2184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2184))

<mark>it. We have to elaborate on what we read just to be able to write it down and translate it into different contexts. We retrieve information from the slip-box whenever we try to connect new notes with old notes.</mark> ([Location 2205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2205))

<mark>But intuition is not the opposition to rationality and knowledge, it is rather the incorporated, practical side of our intellectual endeavours, the sedimented experience on which we build our conscious, explicit knowledge</mark> ([Location 2229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2229))

<mark>The real enemy of independent thinking is not an external authority, but our own inertia. The ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking with old habits of thinking than with coming up with as many ideas as possible.</mark> ([Location 2281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2281))

<mark>We always perceive something as something – our interpretation is instantaneous. This is why we have so much trouble not falling for an optical illusion: If we look at a three-dimensional drawing, we cannot see it just as an arrangement of lines and shapes – unless we are highly trained to do so.</mark> ([Location 2297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2297))

<mark>To really understand a text is therefore a constant revision of our first interpretation. We have to train ourselves to get used to seeing this difference and to hold back our ingrained urge to jump to conclusions.</mark> ([Location 2303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2303))

<mark>While the constant comparison of notes can help us to detect differences, no technique can help us see what is missing. But we can make it a habit to always ask what is not in the picture, but could be relevant. This, too, does not come naturally to us.</mark> ([Location 2309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2309))

<mark>One possibility to deal with this tendency is to ask counterfactual questions, like “what if?”</mark> ([Location 2332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2332))

<mark>The first question should always be directed towards the question itself: What kind of answer can you expect from asking a question in this particular way? What is missing?</mark> ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2337))

<mark>By using the slip-box on a daily basis, we train these important intellectual skills deliberately: We check if what we understood from a text is really in the text by having our understanding in written form in front of our eyes. We learn to focus on the gist of an idea by restricting ourselves in terms of space. We can make it a habit to always think about what is missing when we write down our own ideas. And we can practice asking good questions when we sort our notes into the slip-box and connect them with other notes.</mark> ([Location 2360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2360))

<mark>The restriction to one idea per note is also the precondition to recombine them freely later.</mark> ([Location 2372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2372))

<mark>Each note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling.</mark> ([Location 2374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2374))

<mark>The limitation of the canvas does not make the artistic expressions of painters seem limited, but opens up the possibility of an artist like Lucio Fontana to cut into the canvas instead of painting on it. It is not even true that a more complex structure provides more possibilities. Quite the contrary. The binary code is radically more limited than the alphabet as it contains only two states, one or zero, but it opened up a range of creative possibilities that is unprecedented.</mark> ([Location 2399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2399))

<mark>Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas.</mark> ([Location 2404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2404))

<mark>the fact that someone came up with a lot of ideas during a brainstorming session does not give much indication about their quality.</mark> ([Location 2437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2437))

<mark>It is now less about finding a topic to write about and more about working on the questions we generated by writing.</mark> ([Location 2467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2467))

<mark>If we, on the other hand, let questions arise from the slip-box, we know that they are tried and tested among dozens or even hundreds of other possible questions. The vast majority of questions might have been answered quickly or disappeared as no notes were drawn to them, either because of a lack of interest or a lack of material. This is how evolution works: by trial and error, not planning.</mark> ([Location 2474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2474))

<mark>We have to work, write, connect, differentiate, complement and elaborate on questions – but this is what we do when we take smart notes.</mark> ([Location 2480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2480))

<mark>Nothing motivates us more than seeing a project we can identify with moving forward, and nothing is more demotivating than being stuck with a project that doesn’t seem to be worth doing.</mark> ([Location 2508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2508))

<mark>If we accompany every step of our work with the question, “What is interesting about this?” and everything we read with the question, “What is so relevant about this that it is worth noting down?” we do not just choose information according to our interest. By elaborating on what we encounter, we also discover aspects we didn’t know anything about before and therefore develop our interests along the way. It would be quite sad if we did not change our interests during research.</mark> ([Location 2513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2513))

<mark>The ability to keep control over our work and change course if necessary is made possible by the fact that the big task of “writing a text” is broken down into small, concrete tasks, which allows us practically to do exactly what is needed at a certain time and take the next step from there.</mark> ([Location 2524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2524))

<mark>The key is to structure the draft visibly. It is not so much about deciding once and for all what to write in which chapter or paragraph, but what does not need to be written in a particular part of the manuscript.</mark> ([Location 2545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2545))

<mark>Everything that enriches our slip-box has the potential to end up in a text we might write. By taking smart notes, we collect en passant the material for our future writings in one place. The projects we work on can be in completely different stages of completion. Some of them might not even have come to our attention. This is advantageous not only because we make progress on the next papers or books while we are still working on the current one, but also because it allows us to switch to other projects whenever we get stuck or bored.</mark> ([Location 2565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2565))

<mark>The lesson to draw is to be generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome, not on the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal.</mark> ([Location 2602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2602))

<mark>Disassembling the big challenge of “writing a paper” into small, manageable tasks helps to set realistic goals that can be checked on a regular basis.</mark> ([Location 2610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2610))

<mark>According to the famous law of Parkinson, every kind of work tends to fill the time we set aside for it, like air fills every corner of a room</mark> ([Location 2625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2625))

<mark>The goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects. If we manage to establish a routine in this first step, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turn these findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in the slip-box.</mark> ([Location 2680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2680))
