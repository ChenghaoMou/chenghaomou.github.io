## Highlights
<mark>This is about getting mighty clear about what makes you happy and what makes you feel the most alive, and then creating it instead of pretending you can’t have it.</mark> ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=100))

<mark>It’s about having the cojones to show up as the brightest, happiest, badassiest version of yourself, whatever that looks like to you.</mark> ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=103))

<mark>You need to go from wanting to change your life to deciding to change your life.</mark> ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=105))

<mark>Deciding means jumping in all the way, doing whatever it takes, and going after your dreams with the tenacity of a dateless cheerleader a week before prom night.</mark> ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=108))

<mark>You’ve gotten to where you are right now by doing whatever it is you’re doing, so if you’re less than impressed with your current situation, you clearly need to change things up.</mark> ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=150))

<mark>If you want to live a life you’ve never lived, you have to do things you’ve never done.</mark> ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=153))

<mark>Our subconscious mind contains the blueprint for our lives. It’s running the show based on the unfiltered information it gathered when we were kids, otherwise known as our “beliefs.”</mark> ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=247))

<mark>2) We are, for the most part, completely oblivious to these subconscious beliefs that run our lives.</mark> ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=249))

<mark>3) When our conscious minds finally develop and show up for work, no matter how big and smart and highfalutin they grow to be, they’re still being controlled by the beliefs we’re carrying around in our subconscious minds.</mark> ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=251))

<mark>The first key to ridding yourself of limiting subconscious beliefs is to become aware of them.</mark> ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=293))

<mark>Focus on that which makes you feel good and ye shall find (attract) that which makes you feel good.</mark> ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=356))

<mark>The trick is to have both parts—energy and action—working in unison: unless your energy is lined up properly with that which you desire, really desire, any action you take is going to require way more effort to get you where you want to go, if it gets you there at all.</mark> ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=382))

<mark>If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the present.</mark> ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=399))

<mark>It never ceases to amaze me the precious time we spend chasing the squirrels around our brains, playing out our dramas, worrying about unwanted facial hair, seeking adoration, justifying our actions, complaining about slow Internet connections, dissecting the lives of idiots, when we are sitting in the middle of a full-blown miracle that is happening right here, right now.</mark> ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=420))

<mark>extremely committed to keeping you safely confined within the reality you’ve created based on these limiting false beliefs (otherwise known as your comfort zone).</mark> ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=491))

<mark>Watching someone else totally go for it can be incredibly upsetting to the person who’s spent a lifetime building a solid case for why they themselves can’t.</mark> ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=504))

<mark>Whatever happens, stay the course, because there’s nothing cooler than watching your entire reality shift into one that is the perfect expression of you.</mark> ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=564))

<mark>You get to choose how you perceive your reality. So why, when it comes to perceiving yourself, would you choose to see anything other than a super huge rock star of a creature?</mark> ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=591))

<mark>be. I repeat, you are the only you there is and ever will be. Do not deny the world its one and only chance to bask in your brilliance.</mark> ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=601))

<mark>we invest everything we’ve got in believing that we’re not good enough.</mark> ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=634))

<mark>We’re all busy, but it’s the people who make enjoying their lives a priority who, um, enjoy their lives.</mark> ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=678))

<mark>It’s about being proactive about creating a life you love instead of meekly living the one you think you’re stuck with.</mark> ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=683))

<mark>Do not spend your life clinging to the insulting decisions you’ve made about yourself. Instead, make the conscious choice to replace them with new and improved ones.</mark> ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=716))

<mark>Comparison is the fastest way to take all the fun out of life.</mark> ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=740))

<mark>You aren’t a better person for feeling guilty or bad about yourself, just a sadder one.</mark> ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=751))

<mark>Holding on to my bad feelings about this is doing nothing but harming me, and everyone else, and preventing me from enjoying my life fully. I am an awesome person. I choose to enjoy my life. I choose to let this go.</mark> ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=756))

<mark>DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME GIVING ONE SINGLE CRAP ABOUT WHAT ANYBODY ELSE THINKS OF YOU.</mark> ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=776))

<mark>What other people think about you has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them.</mark> ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=817))

<mark>if you do the absolute best you possibly can, and come from a place of integrity, then you can be proud of yourself and not give a damn what anyone else thinks.</mark> ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=836))

<mark>It still ultimately comes down to what’s true for you, however, so the more connected to your inner truth you are, the easier it will be to use outside opinions to your advantage, rather than let them rule your life.</mark> ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=863))

<mark>Imagine that you’re an alien floating around in outer space and you suddenly swoop down to Earth and inhabit your own body. As the alien, everything about this life is new to you. You look around—what do you see? What is this person who you’ve inhabited so obviously awesome at? What do they have the most fun doing? What connections do they have? What resources and opportunities are available to them?</mark> ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=903))

<mark>You don’t have to know exactly where it’s going to take you, you just need to start with one thing that feels right and keep following right-feeling things and see where they lead.</mark> ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=916))

<mark>No matter how clueless you may feel right now, pay attention to suggestions and opportunities that suddenly present themselves. And notice how you feel—is there something for you that, for whatever reason, feels like it might be good to check out?</mark> ([Location 930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=930))

<mark>But no matter where your first step lands you, if you want to keep moving forward, appreciate wherever you’re at instead of feeling ashamed or grouchy or impatient about it.</mark> ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=937))

<mark>Put yourself out there and you never know what you might learn that will inform your next move, or whom you might meet that will present you with your next opportunity.</mark> ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=957))

<mark>Follow what feels good in the moment, every moment, and it will lead you through a most excellent life.</mark> ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=967))

<mark>Much of the time we pretend we aren’t clear on what our calling is when what’s really going on is that we’re horrified to face it because it seems too big or too impossible to make a living at or completely out of the question for us.</mark> ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B3M3VWS&location=987))
