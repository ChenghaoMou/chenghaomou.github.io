# Error bars




## Abstract
The meaning of error bars is often misinterpreted, as is the statistical significance of their overlap.



<mark style="background: #ff6666">Error bars based on s.d. inform us about the spread of the population and are therefore useful as predictors of the range of new samples. They can also be used to draw attention to very large or small population spreads. Because s.d. bars only indirectly support visual assessment of differences in values, if you use them, be ready to help your reader understand that the s.d. bars reflect the variation of the data and not the error in your measurement. What should a reader conclude from the very large and overlapping s.d. error bars for P = 0.05 in Figure 1b? That although the means differ, and this can be detected with a sufficiently large sample size, there is considerable overlap in the data from the two populations.</mark> [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PUE4BBCE?page=1) 


<mark style="background: #ff6666">Unlike s.d. bars, error bars based on the s.e.m. reflect the uncertainty in the mean and its dependency on the sample size, n (s.e.m. = s.d./√n). Intuitively, s.e.m. bars shrink as we perform more measurements. Unfortunately, the commonly held view that “if the s.e.m. bars do not overlap, the difference between the values is statistically significant” is incorrect. For example, when n = 10 and s.e.m. bars just touch, P = 0.17 (Fig. 1a). Conversely, to reach P = 0.05, s.e.m. bars for these data need to be about 0.86 arm lengths apart (Fig. 1b). We cannot overstate the importance of recognizing the difference between s.d. and s.e.m.</mark> [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PUE4BBCE?page=1) 


<mark style="background: #ff6666">The third type of error bar you are likely to encounter is that based on the CI. This is an interval estimate that indicates the reliability of a measurement3. When scaled to a specific confidence level (CI%)—the 95% CI being common—the bar captures the population mean CI% of the time (Fig. 2a).</mark> [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PUE4BBCE?page=1)
