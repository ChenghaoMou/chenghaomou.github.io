# FACTSCORE: Fine-grained Atomic Evaluation of Factual Precision in Long Form Text Generation







> We also find that, although PerplexityAI provides citations to the references, citations have little correlation with factual precision. 36.0% and 37.6% of supported and unsupported sentences have citations, respectively, indicating that unsupported sentences are in fact marginally more likely to have citations, and the overall citation ratio is low. [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FKE3IDEU?page=6)




> Together with independent findings from Liu et al. (2023a) that citations may have low precision and recall, this indicates that commercial language models that incorporate search and provide citations may not be as reliable as expected. [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FKE3IDEU?page=6)




> All LMs are substantially less factual than humans. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FKE3IDEU?page=10)




> GPT-4 and ChatGPT are significantly more factual than public models. [(p. 11)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FKE3IDEU?page=11)






## Notes



---
TL;DR

An automated model is introduced that estimates FACTSCORE using retrieval and a strong language model, and is used to evaluate 6,500 generations from a new set of 13 recent LMs that would have cost $26K if evaluated by humans, with various findings.
