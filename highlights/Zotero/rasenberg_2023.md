# Reimagining language: Towards a better understanding of language by including our interactions with non-humans




## Abstract
Abstract What is language and who or what can be said to have it? In this essay we consider this question in the context of interactions with non-humans, specifically: animals and computers. While perhaps an odd pairing at first glance, here we argue that these domains can offer contrasting perspectives through which we can explore and reimagine language. The interactions between humans and animals, as well as between humans and computers, reveal both the essence and the boundaries of language: from examining the role of sequence and contingency in human-animal interaction, to unravelling the challenges of natural interactions with “smart” speakers and language models. By bringing together disparate fields around foundational questions, we push the boundaries of linguistic inquiry and uncover new insights into what language is and how it functions in diverse non-human-exclusive contexts.




> However, whereas in human-animal interaction there is ample evidence of reciprocal adaptation, here the adaptation is strikingly one-sided, with robots essentially helpless, requiring care (Lipp 2022) and forcing people to adapt to their constraints (Alač et al. 2020; Suchman 2019). People may start speaking differently to yield to limitations of speech-to-text modules, learn to produce their talk in short chunks, reduce complex and diffuse goals to simple intents, and may even find that their own language is not supported (Litman, Hirschberg &amp; Swerts 2006; Swerts &amp; Ostendorf 1997).
