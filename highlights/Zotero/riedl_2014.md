# The Lovelace 2.0 Test of Artificial Creativity and Intelligence

## Abstract

Observing that the creation of certain types of artistic artifacts necessitate intelligence, we present the Lovelace 2.0 Test of creativity as an alternative to the Turing Test as a means of determining whether an agent is intelligent. The Lovelace 2.0 Test builds off prior tests of creativity and additionally provides a means of directly comparing the relative intelligence of different agents.

<mark style="background: #ff8c82">The Turing Test was never meant to be conducted; indeed many practical methodological details are left absent Regardless of Turing’s intent, the Turing Test has been adopted as a rigorous test of the intelligence capability of computational systems.</mark> [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3RYT4ZNK?page=1)

<mark style="background: #fff76a">One of the weaknesses of the Turing Test as a diagnostic tool for intelligence is its reliance on deception (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2012); agents that are successful at the Turing Test and the closely related Loebner Prize Competition are those that fool human judges for short amounts of time partially by evading the judges’ questions.</mark> [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3RYT4ZNK?page=1)

<mark style="background: #ff4015">An artificial agent a, designed by h, passes the Lovelace Test if and only if: • a outputs o, • a’s outputting o is the result of processes a can repeat and not a fluke hardware error, and • h (or someone who knows what h knows and has h’s resources) cannot explain how a produced o.</mark> [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3RYT4ZNK?page=1)

<mark style="background: #ff4015">Computational creativity is the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems that, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviors that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. There are no conclusive tests of whether a computational system exhibits creativity.</mark> [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3RYT4ZNK?page=1)

<mark style="background: #ff4015">The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows: • a must create an artifact o of type t; • o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is any criterion expressible in natural language; • a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and • a human referee r determines the combination of t and C to not be unrealistic for an average human.</mark> [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3RYT4ZNK?page=2)

<mark style="background: #ff4015">The human referee r is necessary to prevent the situation where the evaluator presents the agent with a combination of t and C that might be extremely difficult to meet even by humans. The referee should be an expert on t who can veto judge inputs based on his or her expert opinion on what is known about t and average human abilities.</mark> [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3RYT4ZNK?page=2)

<mark style="background: #fff76a">Regardless of whether the human judge is an expert in artificial intelligence or not, the evaluator is given the chance to craft a set of constraints that he or she would expect the agent to be unable to meet. Thus if the judge is acting with the intent to disprove the intelligence, the judge should experience an element of surprise if the agent passes a challenge.</mark> [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3RYT4ZNK?page=2)

<mark style="background: #fff76a">The ability to repeat the test with more or harder constraints enables the judge to test the limits of the agent’s intelligence. These features are at the expense of a halting condition—the test provides no threshold at which one can declare an artificial agent to be intelligent. However, the test provides a means to quantitatively compare artificial agents. Creativity is not unique to human intelligence, but it is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence.</mark> [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3RYT4ZNK?page=2)
