# The ASA Statement on p-Values: Context, Process, and Purpose

<mark style="background: #5fb236">Appropriately chosen techniques, properly conducted analyses and correct interpretation of statistical results also play a key role in ensuring that conclusions are sound and that uncertainty surrounding them is represented properly.</mark> [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L67EHAC7?page=4)

<mark style="background: #5fb236">Pragmatic considerations often require binary, “yes-no” decisions, but this does not mean that p-values alone can ensure that a decision is correct or incorrect. The widespread use of “statistical significance” (generally interpreted as “p   0.05”) as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding (or implied truth) leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process.</mark> [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L67EHAC7?page=4)

<mark style="background: #5fb236">Cherrypicking promising findings, also known by such terms as data dredging, significance chasing, significance questing, selective inference, and “p-hacking,” leads to a spurious excess of statistically significant results in the published literature and should be vigorously avoided. One need not formally carry out multiple statistical tests for this problem to arise: Whenever a researcher chooses what to present based on statistical results, valid interpretation of those results is severely compromised if the reader is not informed of the choice and its basis. Researchers should disclose the number of hypotheses explored during the study, all data collection decisions, all statistical analyses conducted, and all p-values computed. Valid scientific conclusions based on p-values and related statistics cannot be drawn without at least knowing how many and which analyses were conducted, and how those analyses (including p-values) were selected for reporting.</mark> [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L67EHAC7?page=5)

<mark style="background: #5fb236">Researchers should recognize that a p-value without context or other evidence provides limited information. For example, a p-value near 0.05 taken by itself offers only weak evidence against the null hypothesis. Likewise, a relatively large p-value does not imply evidence in favor of the null hypothesis; many other hypotheses may be equally or more consistent with the observed data. For these reasons, data analysis should not end with the calculation of a p-value when other approaches are appropriate and feasible.</mark> [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L67EHAC7?page=5)
