# Long-form factuality in large language models




## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics. To benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38 topics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore, we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality. To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response (precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter representing a user's preferred response length (recall). Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating performance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time. At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times cheaper than human annotators. We also benchmark thirteen language models on LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality. LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality.




> We use the language model to first decompose a long-form response into individual facts, then for each fact, propose fact-checking queries to send to a Google Search API and reason about whether the fact is supported by search results (Section 3). We name this method SAFE (Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator).3 Empirically, SAFE achieves superhuman performance, agreeing with 72% of human annotations from Min et al. (2023) and winning 76% of disagreement cases from a random sample of 100 disagreement cases (Section 4). SAFE is also 20× cheaper than human annotators.

> (a) split a long-form response into individual self-contained facts, (b) determine whether each individual fact is relevant to answering the prompt in the context of the response, and (c) for each relevant fact, iteratively issue Google Search queries in a multi-step process and reason about whether the search results support or do not support the fact.

TL;DR

The proposed Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE) utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results.
