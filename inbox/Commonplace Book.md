* The image of things looks way better than the actually of things
* We are all victims of the fads of our current time

* Brainwashing depends on the ignorance of the victims
* Life is a storm. We bask in the sunlight one moment and are shattered on the rocks the next.

**Psychology**

* Your enemy is never a villain in their own eyes

* If you pull the right strings a puppet will dance for you any way you desire
* Hypnotized by the monologues inside our own heads
* Applying labels to people can create a looping effect. It can change the behavior of the person being labeled and become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

* Each of us has a rich, dynamic consciousness. Humans are seething with complexity. Our body are a mere casing of a sentience and intelligence that you can never fully understand
* Like every other mental ability, it may be in error or reflect wishful thinking rather than heightened self-awareness. When this happens, you might engage in an endless quest for an idea that doesn’t exist, such as the fountain of youth.

**Politics & Media**

* The internet has a bias for novelty. By prioritizing recency, every social media platform directs our attention to the trivial over the timeless. We should pursue eternal wisdom and transcend the media industrial complex.
* Taking offensive is a response that implies some rejection of reality
* Brainwashing seminars in the form of media, synthetic emotions in the form of pills, mind-altering chemicals in the form of food, controlled bubbles in the form of social networks, psychological warfare in the form of advertising.
* If you shut off mainstream media, the world’s problems slowly go away and you begin to find common ground with those around you.
* Life is too short for all the junk we feed out brains
* Negativity is good at marketing
* You don’t have to agree with politicians to be a patriot
* World problems require us to be calm and collected to solve and yet we’re whipped up into a mad frenzy
* Keep the television on like a running tap
* There’s little added value to my life as a result of news consumption. It always gets words, so eliminating news is eliminating a negative. The job of the news is to make everyone’s problem, your problem. News stations exist to keep attention, not to disseminate truth. The really true stuff is not interesting and will fail compares to sensationalized news. It is dollars versus cents. It’s the nature of the business. They craft narratives, and don’t incentive us to think and put the pieces together. Here’s what bad things are happening, isn’t it terrible? We have catastrophized the world.
* The closer ordinary people are to political power the better. The problem is that we have people to separate from those they serve.
* They are not willing to attack the system they are now a part of

**Social Media**

* If the world was blind, who would you impress?
* There is nothing good that social media adds to a relationship.
* We’re people chasing validation, leveraging their online social status, trying to pretend they live in a perfect world.
* I think it comes down to your definition of success. If you’re not doing what you love, fame, wealth, notoriety, is not pure success.
* It’s the age of the quick fix, where no one wants to put the effort or dedication in
* People will know within seconds of seeing you whether your offer is something you’re confident in or not. Subconsciously, we can kind of read each other’s intent. And for me, I’m passionate, I love seeing people grow their influence using my help whatever it may be.
* The reason why most of the social media isn't good for us is because we’re procrastinating and because you’ve been led to believe wrongfully, that listening to a podcast, reading a book, watching a video is taking action.
* You can’t force desire for your services, you can only draw attention to the solution it provides. And this is done by your content and online presence
* We’re in a society of information overload and execution depletion
* The longer your bio, the less you’ve done. Any adult would not put 10 emojis around the 8 different businesses they’ve created. It’s corny.
* All you need is a PR feature from a publication site and you’re this credible figure.
* We seek to follow in the reflection of other people’s lives

**Speaking & Language**

* It’s incredible to hear someone who thinks logically, explains clearly, and uses language effectively. We’ve grown accustomed to illogic, innuendo, and vagueness that it’s strange to hear someone so staggeringly genuine.
* Develop your communication skills, because once you open your mouth you tell the world who you are
* There’s an infantilism of public discourse
* Think critically, don’t let someone else bypass your reason and logic
* You can understand something intellectually and theoretically, but to apply it yourself is an entire other battle. “Intelligence is knowing the right solution. Wisdom is knowing when to apply it.”
* Speaker’s triad
* We have a word wizard in our midsts
* Do you want to take us forward?
* **Improv Structure** (Tell a story, mention implications of story, strong finish with callback phrase)
* Improv speaking is giving yourself a pep talk
* What we have in society is a failure to communicate\! I want a flawless use of language, using words to sculpt deeper meaning.
* We use punchy, monosyllabic words.
* Develop the art of seeing life, the world around you, and ourselves with greater candor and unclouded clarity
* If you want to speak effectively, you have to know way more than what you’re talking about.
* Tying back to broader themes (Twitter \= History of Media/Work backwards)
* Language is a very low bandwidth mechanism
* In science, philosophy, and thought it has become clear that our world cannot be captured in the net of language. It is a map of the terrain and not the terrain itself.
* Consciousness is based on the enormous discarding of information
* The speaker collapses a massive amount of information into a very small amount of information in the form of what is spoken
* The director works with the actors to convert a low amount of information in text into a far greater amount of information present in the performance
* The function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being overwhelmed and confused by large amounts of useless and irrelevant knowledge by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive or remember.
* Pausing \- the longer the computation time the greater the depth

**Historical Excerpts**

* **Spectacle of the Scaffold** by Michel Foucault (foo-coe) discusses how punishment was used to make an example of people to subjugate the masses. This concentrated absolute power and made it easily usurpable.
* **Panopticon** \- a concept created by English philosopher Jeremy Bentham
* Smart, honest and communist \- pick one of the three
* **In a tangle of history, there is no thread we can follow back. What is in the past is inaccessible to is other than through historical research, theory, and guesswork**

**Life & Motivation**

* Am I inventing busywork to avoid the important work?
* Anyone can get on a mental high. You don’t make money through midsent, but by bringing value to the market.
* I only get what I take the chance to ask for
* Am I enjoying myself in the present? Then that’s all that matters, and there’s nothing else I can do to enjoy the present but simply live it. Someday, I will give anything for 5 more minutes of this.
* Clarity doesn’t come from thinking, it comes from doing.
* Confidence comes from achievement in situations in which one has not been confident
* We are anticipatory beings and get excitement from expecting something. Your brain is hardwired for you to never be able to meet those standards. It will always pitch potential reality higher than actual reality.
* Let the negative thoughts flow past (like water under your feet)
* Think deeply about the world, think lightly about yourself
* “Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.”

**Future & Technology**

* **The Singularity** is a future period in which the pace of technological change will so rapid, it’s impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed
* When accounting for future change, exponential growth is ignored. Many of us have “linear intuition“ in which we predict the future rate of progress based on the rate of progress made most recently or in the immediate past.
* Civilization is about attaining predictability and technology is about making things predictable and repeatable so we do not need to devote so much time and attention to them.
* The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.

**Analogies & Anecdotes**

* Blind man feeling the elephant. To him, the ear is a leaf, the trunk a snake, the leg a stump.
* Music is a commentary on the visuals
