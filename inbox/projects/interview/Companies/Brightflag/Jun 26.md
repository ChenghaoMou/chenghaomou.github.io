**Why did you leave your last job?**

I have been working at DocuSign for more than 2 years, I have learned a lot professionally and personally. But slowly, the work had become more difficult, not due to technical issues or challenges, but because of politics. Even a small change had to jump through a lot of hoops. e.g. ever since I joined DS, people have been pushing for a tool adoption, it only came through very recently after almost three years. Collaboration and communication between US and Ireland has also been challenging, leading to many siloed projects. There is no shared learning across teams, and decisions that are impacting our teams are often made without notifying us. My teammates and I had tried to push changes, but received little to no support from our management.

**Why do you want to join Brightflag?**

My strong skillset in applied NLP experience aligns very well with Brightflag's mission to streamline legal and finance administrative work; I believe I can leverage my skills, building solutions from scratch to production, to contribute meaningfully to products and make impact on the customers; Brightflag has the highest glassdoor review: 4.8/5 I have ever seen; Many reviews mentioned that bf is a great place for work and even how encouraging and positive the interview process is.
