## Why CalypsoAI

My skills and interests align well with CalypsoAI's mission for GenAI application security. I have worked in information extraction domain for more than four years and have been working on a privacy/sensitive information related project for the past year. My previous job in an email security startup also enabled me to apply NLP techniques to understanding communication behaviours, intents that can be transferred to the prompt domain. I think CalypsoAI offers a perfect opportunity for me to tackle cutting-edge technical challenges in applied NLP products.

I have been working as an MLE for the past four and half years. My primary focus was building NLP applications for understanding unstructured document data, email communications and leverage them for information extraction systems.
