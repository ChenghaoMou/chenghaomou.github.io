**Why do you want to work at Fresco?**

Short version is that the ability to build something that can reach million customers through cooking. Through out the pandemic, premade meal services provided a temporary solution that created a lot of packaing waste. It is also a potential medium for fighting against food waste or customise cooking for each one's preference. Helping people cooking at home with locally sourced produce/ingradients feels more independent and sustainable. In a way, cooking shares a lot of similarity with programming and the power of creating something delicious out of raw ingradients has always been a passion of mine.

**Why did you leave your last job?**

I have been working at DocuSign for more than 2 years, I have learned a lot professionally and personally. But slowly, the work had become more difficult, not due to technical issues or challenges, but because of politics. Even a small change had to jump through a lot of hoops. e.g. ever since I joined DS, people have been pushing for a tool adoption, it only came through very recently after almost three years. Collaboration and communication between US and Ireland has also been challenging, leading to many siloed projects. There is no shared learning across teams, and decisions that are impacting our teams are often made without notifying us. My teammates and I had tried to push changes, but received little to no support from our management.

**Can you tell me what your weaknesses are?**

Earlier in my career, sometimes I was too eager to jump into actions without verifying assumptions, especially working in a medium or large company where communication overhead can be non-trivial. There was one time I made an assumption about data scheme without verifying it with the upstream team, I had to fix the issue much later with a lot of refactoring work when I started testing end2end.

But I have learned my lesson to align with other people first regarding hypotheses before starting working on implementation. Even when implementing, I learned to solicit feedbacks and concerns iteratively with MVPs.

**What in particular could you bring to the team that perhaps other candidates could not?**

The willingness to get my hands dirty with data to drive data quality one step further.

Values

- Foster **mutual trust and respect**: We nurture ideas and allow them to grow. We offer solutions instead of shutting off thought processes and keep criticism constructive.

1. Coworker suggested some improvement for CICD pipeline for better local testing, even though it is not directly related to the output quality, I helped him setting it up and made a few incremental changes, now our deployment time is halfed.
---

- Share your views, listen to others': Anyone can influence how we run our company. Everyone should be eager to **hear feedback**, and be ready to show **action against that feedback**.

1. ex-manager on how to work with more stakeholders, sell my idea to the upper leadership (learning: more communication)
---

- Care deeply about **customer experience**: Everything we do should reflect our respect and understanding of great design and customer experience. We put our customers first.

4. Security hashing for customers, slower for computation for us.
---

- Be **effective**, not busy: We optimize the time we spend reaching a shared goal. We focus on the **root cause**, rather than symptoms and drive to reach completion.

1. PM did not provide answers or support when requested for help. Talked to engineers directly who were working on the project.
2. data schema is underdefined both from data producer and data consumer, different time zone and different teams (**learning**: how to effectively solicit requirements cross-functional teams)

---

- **Bias for action**: We act in the best interest of our partners, home cooks, and team. We take ownership of problems and don’t wait for someone else to do it.

5. Waiting for help from another team on a feature request for too long. I decided to take matters into my own hands to implement a workaround for spark loggings. (**learning**: thinking out of the box)
6. Small things to improve developer experience: code formatting and linting and slack support channel and group* (learning: work environment to allow flexibility)
---

- Think big, start small: Fail fast, learn, and adapt. Half of our ideas won't work, but, we make what we believe is right and **learn from our mistakes**.

1. incorrect assumptions about data schema: offset due to undocumented behavior (**learning**: assumptions should be promptly verified especially from cross-functional teams)
---

- Ruthlessly prioritize: We use our time on what is most important, not what is most urgent, and are comfortable saying **no to attractive distractions**.

8. Pushed back for not readily applicable solutions that require a lot of friction and overhead.
---

- Make food more: We practice what we preach. We cook with Fresco-connected experiences at the office and at home to test, experiment and enjoy delicious food.
