Values

- Foster **mutual trust and respect**: We nurture ideas and allow them to grow. We offer solutions instead of shutting off thought processes and keep criticism constructive.

1. Coworker suggested some improvement for CICD pipeline for better local testing, even though it is not directly related to the output quality, I helped him setting it up and made a few incremental changes, now our deployment time is halfed.
---

- Share your views, listen to others': Anyone can influence how we run our company. Everyone should be eager to **hear feedback**, and be ready to show **action against that feedback**.

1. ex-manager on how to work with more stakeholders, sell my idea to the upper leadership (learning: more communication)
---

- Care deeply about **customer experience**: Everything we do should reflect our respect and understanding of great design and customer experience. We put our customers first.

4. Security hashing for customers, slower for computation for us.
---

- Be **effective**, not busy: We optimize the time we spend reaching a shared goal. We focus on the **root cause**, rather than symptoms and drive to reach completion.

1. PM did not provide answers or support when requested for help. Talked to engineers directly who were working on the project.
2. data schema is underdefined both from data producer and data consumer, different time zone and different teams (**learning**: how to effectively solicit requirements cross-functional teams)

---

- **Bias for action**: We act in the best interest of our partners, home cooks, and team. We take ownership of problems and donâ€™t wait for someone else to do it.

5. Waiting for help from another team on a feature request for too long. I decided to take matters into my own hands to implement a workaround for spark loggings. (**learning**: thinking out of the box)
6. Small things to improve developer experience: code formatting and linting and slack support channel and group* (learning: work environment to allow flexibility)
---

- Think big, start small: Fail fast, learn, and adapt. Half of our ideas won't work, but, we make what we believe is right and **learn from our mistakes**.

1. incorrect assumptions about data schema: offset due to undocumented behavior (**learning**: assumptions should be promptly verified especially from cross-functional teams)
---

- Ruthlessly prioritize: We use our time on what is most important, not what is most urgent, and are comfortable saying **no to attractive distractions**.

8. Pushed back for not readily applicable solutions that require a lot of friction and overhead.
---

- Make food more: We practice what we preach. We cook with Fresco-connected experiences at the office and at home to test, experiment and enjoy delicious food.
