## Why did you leave?

I have been working at DocuSign for more than 2 years, I have learned a lot professionally and personally. But slowly, the work had become more difficult, not due to technical issues or challenges, but because of politics. Even a small change had to jump through a lot of hoops. e.g. ever since I joined DS, people have been pushing for a tool adoption, it only came through very recently after almost three years. Collaboration and communication between US and Ireland has also been challenging, leading to many siloed projects. There is no shared learning across teams, and decisions that are impacting our teams are often made without notifying us. My teammates and I had tried to push changes, but received little to no support from our management.

## What are you looking for

I want to commit to a job where I can meaningfully contribute to with my skills and experience and prefer working in tight knit team with everyone's voice can be heard. I thrive in technical challenges and always has a passion with natural langauge processing. I used to commute 2 hours every day sitting on a bus just to work at a research lab on something I liked.

For the next 3-5 years, I want to be a domain expert in what I do and be able to lead small to medium teams to complete projects that bring significant business value to the company.
