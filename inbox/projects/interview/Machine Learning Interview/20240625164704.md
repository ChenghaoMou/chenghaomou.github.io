# Online Model Evaluation

A/B testing: A(control) vs B(variation):

- Null hypothesis $H_0$: there is no difference between the versions;
- The alternative hypothesis $H_1$: the change has an effect on the variation;

A power analysis test should be conducted to demine how much overall traffic should be given to the system â€” the minimum sample size required to see the impact of change. Half of the traffic is sent to the control.

## P-value

A significance level $\alpha$ is determined before a statistical testing (calculating the p-value):

1. $p \le \alpha$, reject $H_0$;
2. fail to reject $H_0$ otherwise;

## Back Testing

Switch variantion and control for another round of testing.

## Long-running A/B Test

If there is any concern over the long-term impact of a change, a long-running A/B test can be carried out.
