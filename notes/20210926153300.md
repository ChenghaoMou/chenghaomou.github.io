# Adaptive Computation

It is a concept that models can perform conditional computation, primarily based on the input.

For example, models can spend more computation on difficult problems and less on easy ones or treat those questions in different ways from different perspectives (task format, sequence length etc).

However, it is known for **unstable results** and **sensitivity towards hyper-parameters**, especially those controlling **the trade off between computation and accuracy** (e.g. $\tau$ in Adaptive Computation Time (ACT)[^1]).
