# Randomness in Scikit-learn

Use `RandomState` to make sure your code
- is reproducible between runs
- maintains randomness within the pipeline

Avoid setting the global random seed â€“ it can fix all the randomness for any code subsequently involved, including caller code.

This should also be applied to other frameworks like PyTorch, Numpy, or Tensorflow.
