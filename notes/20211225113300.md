# Incorrect Labels

Machine learning models are robust even when there are **random errors** in the training set. But it is less so when they are **systematic errors/biases**.

When there are incorrect labels in the validation or test set, it is important to evaluate the percentage of those *correctable errors*. If the errors are worth the efforts more so than the in-correctable examples (actual mistakes from the model), then:
1. Find out what went wrong
2. Apply the fix to both the validation and test sets
