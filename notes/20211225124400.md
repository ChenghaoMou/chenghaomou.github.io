# Deep Work

## Why is Deep Work Important?

To be valuable in the job market and society, one needs expertise in his/her domains and the capability to learn and produce things fast, and deep work can help us achieve that â€“ being in the flow state pushes your mind to expand its boundary as well as horns your skills to a deeper level.

## Why is Deep Work so Rare?

The connectivity brought by internet tools leaves us no room for distraction-free focus and an uninterrupted time window, which is enforced in our daily lives and eventually becomes a vicious habit that corrupts our minds.

## Why Does it Work?

It reinforces the neural circuits when we learn and work while being focused.

## How to Commit to Deep Work?

Just like any habit you want to culture, you have to practice it. Our actions cast votes for who we want to become. Design routines, rituals and cues to guide you instead of relying on willpower or motivation.
