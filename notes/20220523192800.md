# Cost Equivalent Curve

**Cost**: the number of training examples in the training set used.
**Performance**s: the performance given a model and a cost according to the task metric.
**Cost Equivalent Curve**: a curve depicting the relation between cost and performance. For a target performance score, the smaller the cost is, the better the model is.

The underlying assumption of the curve is that such relationship between cost and performance is *continuous* and *strictly monotonic*.
