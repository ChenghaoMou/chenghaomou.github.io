# Transfer Learning Approaches

**Multitask Training**: Train the model on all tasks/datasets all at once;

**Sequential Multitask Training**: Train the model on some tasks/datasets first before continue training it with the target tasks/datasets;

**Multitask Training and Fine-tuning**: Train the model on some tasks first and fine-tuning it with target tasks/datasets;

Findings from @lourie_2021a that
1. Sequential Multitask Training almost always outperform other methods.
2. Multitask training helps the most when target data is scarce.
3. Larger models see more gains from transfer learning.
