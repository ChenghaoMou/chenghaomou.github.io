# How to Remember Names

- Initially, a name and a face are not associated until your hippocampus puts them together into a single memory;
- Instead of focusing on introducing yourself, pay more attention to learning them. **HEAR** the name;
- Learn the name properly:
	- Practice retrieval the name
	- Search for something to remember the name by
	- Search for some facial features
	- **Take some notes in the Apple notes (add some facts as well)**
	- Connect on social media
- This is a skill that needs practice.
