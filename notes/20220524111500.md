# How to Work Hard

## Why Work Hard

We cannot change our talents, so work hard is, in most cases, the only choice.

Some may argue work smart is the way to go. But in this case, work hard and work smart aren't mutually exclusive. Work hard in a sense that we choose challenges. [[Staring into the abyss as a core life skill]], as one might say. Work smart in a sense that to solve those challenges, we need to hone on our skills to make the solution and the process efficient.

## How to Work Hard

1. Define your goals and foster disciplines:
    2. Problems, scopes, domains, and habits
3. Two mindsets:
	1. Enjoy achievement
	2. Dislike idleness
4. Learn your work:
	1. What matches your talent might not be your interest
	2. Know what is important and interesting
5. Plan ahead:
	1. Avoid diminishing returns and burnout
6. Work towards the **hard-core center problems**, a.k.a. [[Staring into the abyss as a core life skill|staring into the abyss]].
