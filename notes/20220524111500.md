# How to Work Hard

## Why Working Hard

We cannot change our talents, so working hard is, in most cases, the only choice.

Some may argue that working smart is the best approach. However, in this case, working hard and working smart are not mutually exclusive. Working hard means choosing challenges. [[Staring into the abyss as a core life skill]], as some might say. Working smart means honing our skills to solve those challenges efficiently.

## How to Work Hard

1. Define your goals and foster disciplines:
    2. Problems, scopes, domains, and habits
3. Two mindsets:
	1. Enjoy achievement
	2. Dislike idleness
4. Learn your work:
	1. What matches your talent might not be your interest
	2. Know what is important and interesting
5. Plan ahead:
	1. Avoid diminishing returns and burnout
6. Work towards the **hard-core center problems**, a.k.a. [[Staring into the abyss as a core life skill|staring into the abyss]].
