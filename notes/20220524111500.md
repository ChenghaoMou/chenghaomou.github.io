# How to Work Hard

## Why Working Hard

We cannot change our talents, so working hard is, in most cases, the only choice.

Some may argue working smart is the way to go. But in this case, working hard and working smart aren't mutually exclusive. Working hard in the sense that we choose challenges. [[Staring into the abyss as a core life skill]], as one might say. Working smart means that to solve those challenges, we must hone our skills to make the solution and the process efficient.

## How to Work Hard

1. Define your goals and foster disciplines:
    2. Problems, scopes, domains, and habits
3. Two mindsets:
	1. Enjoy achievement
	2. Dislike idleness
4. Learn your work:
	1. What matches your talent might not be your interest
	2. Know what is important and interesting
5. Plan ahead:
	1. Avoid diminishing returns and burnout
6. Work towards the **hard-core center problems**, a.k.a. [[Staring into the abyss as a core life skill|staring into the abyss]].
