# When to Have Credit Card Debt

1. When your goal is to reduce risk: having mortgage instead of depleting your emergency funds.
2. When the return of having the debt is larger than the cost. E.g., higher education.
    3. Simple formula for calculating the return
        4. Value of the degree today = Increased Lifetime Earnings / 2 - Oppotunity Cost of the Degree (money you could have earned with the time you spend on study)
3. Avoid debt if it causes mental stress, especially non-mortgage debt.
