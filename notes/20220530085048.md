# When to Retire

Note: This is heavily related to the United States, and might not generalize well to other economy.

## 4% Rule

$$
4\% \times \textit{Total Savings} = \textit{Annual Spending}
$$

Which leads to another simple equation:

$$
\textit{Total Savings} = 25 \times \textit{Annual Spending}
$$

Assuming that your spending does not change over the years of retirement, though it is most likely not true.

## Crossover Rule

It refers to when your investment yields larger return than your annual spending.

## Retirement is Not Just About Money

There are many other factors that you should consider when deciding when to retire:
1. Physical and mental well-beings
2. Social support
3. Fulfillment
    4. Early retirement takes your job out of your identity and as a result makes your life less motivational.
