# 2x Rule

Source: [[20220530100701|Just Keep Buying]]

Every time you spend $x$ on something, spend the same amount of money on investment.

Similarly, people who practice minimalism also have this rule of thumb when making purchases where the expenses, time, and energy of keeping it around and finally disposing of it are taken into consideration. In the end, you end up with a number that is likely 2x or 3x larger than the price tag.

By this rule, combined with minimalist purchasing considerations, we are actually paying 2x in monetary value and 2x in post-purchase cost to maintain an item.
