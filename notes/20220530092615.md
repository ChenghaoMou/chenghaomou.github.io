We return to our normal level of happiness regardless of how many happy/extreme events we experience in the short term. This is called [Hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill#:~:text=Hedonic%20adaptation%20is%20a%20process,that%20occur%20in%20their%20environment.) in psychology.

As a consequence, chasing after happiness is a wrong quest, because eventually you can't stop chasing or can't be happy ever after. Instead, we should aim for fulfilment — making an impact with our decisions and making it count. Or as someone may call it, contentment[^1].
