# Happiness VS Fulfillment

We return to our normal level of happiness even after experiencing some positive events in short term. This is called [Hedonic treadmill - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill#:~:text=Hedonic%20adaptation%20is%20a%20process,that%20occur%20in%20their%20environment.).

Then it is clear that chasing after happiness is a wrong quest and instead, we should aim for fulfillment — making impact with our decisions and making it count.

> Pursue something so important that even if you fail the world is better off with you having tried.
