# Key Components in Data-centric AI

References: [[20210928180400|Data-centric AI]]

1. Data. (Dah!)
2. Programmatic access: higher level of data manipulation that also takes into considerations such as:
	1. Privacy concerns;
	2. Domain expertise;
	3. Rapid changes from the real world;
	4. Ethical concerns (bias, audits, lineage);
3. Expertise: labeling and modeling should be unified into a positive feedback loop instead of individual components. Labeled data help to design better models and algorithms, and the modeling process provide the labeling process with guidance.
