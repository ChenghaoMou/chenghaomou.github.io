# Premeditatio Malorum

By imagining the worst-case scenarios, you overcome the paralysis and take action.

## Fear Setting

> Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.

> Jerzy Gregorek

> We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.
>
> Seneca

1. What if I `do something` I will have the `consequences`? I can `do something` to prevent it or `do something` to fix it.
2. What are the benefits of an attempt to fix?
3. What is the cost of inaction[^1]?

Be prepared for the worst, and practice being calm even if it happens.
