# Premeditatio Malorum

By imagining the worst-case scenarios, you overcome the paralysis and take action.

## Fear Setting

> Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.

> Jerzy Gregorek

> We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.

> Seneca

## Question to Ask Oneself

1. If I take the action and meet with the consequences, can I do something else to prevent or fix them?
2. What are the benefits if I do attempt to fix the issues?
3. What is the cost of inaction vs action[^1] [^2]?

Be prepared for the worst, and keep calm even if it happens.
