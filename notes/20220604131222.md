# Premeditatio Malorum

By imaging the worst case scenarios, you overcome the paralysis and take actions.

## Fear Setting

> Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.

> We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.

1. What if I `do something`, then I will have the `consequences`. I can `do something` to prevent it or `do something` to fix it.
2. What are the benefits of an attempt to fix or partial fix?
3. What are the cost of inaction?

Be prepared for the worst, and practice being calm even if it happens.
