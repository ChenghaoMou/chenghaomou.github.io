# Chain of Thought (CoT)

Reference: [[kojima_2022]]

By prompting models to "think" step by step, chain of thought prompting helps model:
1. decompose a complex question into easier ones
2. facilitate clearer and better explanation for models' decisions

It includes both zero-shot CoT and few-shot CoT.

## When to Use

1. When model is relatively large
2. In commonsense reasoning tasks, zero-shot CoT does not help

This, however, does not mean the model is capable of reasoning. It only makes the model output/generation more applaudable in our own sense-making interpretation ([[20221210185344|On the Dangers of Large Generative Models]])
