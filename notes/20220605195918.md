# How to Prevent Model From Learning Spurious Correlations

## 2. Making Room for Uncertainty

Instead of forcing model to output a result or a semi-educated guess, design the system to allow models to express its uncertainty, to interact with human when confidence is low and to abstain otherwise.

## 3. Zero-shot or Few-shot Learning

If the knowledge is learned â€” if model's performance on such task is close to or surpasses human baseline, maybe you don't need to fine-tune the model with possible spurious correlations.
