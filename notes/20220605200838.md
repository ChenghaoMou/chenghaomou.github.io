# Data Balancing

The goal of data balancing is to remove or reduce spurious correlation between the data and the label.

For example, single-word features can be balanced by making sure that given a label, the probability of each word occurring in the dataset is the same. But compound features would also be needed for that purpose.

Just like many other things in machine learning, this has some trade-offs:
1. Too much balancing leads to no learnable signal: the model would never have enough information to make a decision as all assumptions are equally possible.
2. Too little balancing makes the dataset biased and less generalizable.

It is inevitable that dataset has some spurious correlations especially when the definition of spurious varies from one context to another.
