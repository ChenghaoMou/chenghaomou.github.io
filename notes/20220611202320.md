# Critical Point of Breakthrough

Reference: [[srivastava_2022|Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and extrapolating the capabilities of language models]], [[schaeffer_2023|Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?]]

It is observed that as the parameter size increases, some tasks see a steep increase during the evaluation, as though the model reaches some kind of breakthrough point. This is also referred to as emergent abilities.

A closer look reveals a different story:
1. The breakthrough is largely contributed by the zero-sum, nonlinear, or discontinuous metrics, even when the model is gradually learning to assign a higher probability to the correct answer. But it will continue to be a failure before it crosses the threshold. Therefore, it is suggested that we should use a smoother metric instead to measure the progress. (Exact match vs token edit distance, accuracy vs brier score)
2. The task itself indeed requires a significant amount of knowledge to be learned by the model. Such tasks often involve multistep reasoning or compound components.s
