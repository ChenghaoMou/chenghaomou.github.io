1. Scaling improves models' performance, and sparsity also helps. But sadly, models are still far behind human performance;
2. Tasks that show linear relation with model size are generally knowledge-driven tasks;
3. [[20220611202320|Crital Point of Breakthrough]]
4. ==Social bias scales with the model when the context isn't clear. Prompting helps;==
5. Language models make poorly calibrated predictions, but scaling helps. ([[20220611204059|Calibration Evaluation]])
6. Task formatting is also an important factor, but it may not be the case when the model is significantly large or efficiently trained with quality data;
