# Feeling Rich

Rich is a relative concept. Such relativity will always be present throughout your life.

Instead of trying to feel rich, we should feel the growth. By pivoting ourselves to a more friendly yesterday vs. now comparison, we motivate ourselves to make better decisions every day. But be aware of the comparison trap: Normally we never compare ourselves with billionaires because the gap of our wealth is beyond reach. We do, however, to our detriment, compare ourselves with someone who shares something in common with us. What we fail to see in such comparisons is that it will never be fair. Our life experience isn't simply comparable or summarizable with solely the net worth.
