## Roth 401(k)

## Important Factors When Considering 401(k)

| Type        | Category | When to Choose                             |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 401(k)      | pre-tax  | future tax rate is lower than current rate |
| Roth 401(k) | post-tax | current tax rate is lower than future rate |

e.g. If you live in a high tax rate location, then it is best to invest in traditional 401(k) than Roth 401(k).

## Don't Max Out Your 401(k)

Maxing out your 401(k) means that you don't have much flexibility. It is best to take into consideration of all the factors before making the decision:
1. financial goals
2. cost of 401(k) plan
3. individual circumstances
