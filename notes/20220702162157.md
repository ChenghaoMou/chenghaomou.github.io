# Graph Optimization

Source: [[Optimizing Transformers with Hugging Face Optimum]]

Graph optimization is one of many ways of [[20220620162157|Machine Learning Optimization]]. Usually, there are three approaches:

1. Constant folding: evaluating constant expressions at compile time instead of runtime;
2. Redundant node elimination: removing redundant computation nodes from the graph;
3. Operator fusion: combining two or more operators into one;
