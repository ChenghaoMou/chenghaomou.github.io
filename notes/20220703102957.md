# The Independent Researcher

## Mindset

- We don't need anyone's permission to do research[^2];
- We don't need a degree program to do research, but we do need some education on how to do research efficiently and ethically. A degree is only one of many options[^3];
- Research is being of service to the public and the community[^1];
- Beware of the negativity[^11], but keep a positive mind and enjoy the joy[^12].

## PhD

You need to work as 50% hard as a PhD student to become one[^4]. (e.g, you need papers in top conferences so that your PhD application can be somewhat competitive)

## Validation

- It's hard to convince other people that you are good at what you're doing without any external validation/proof[^5];
- We seek validation not for our egos, reputations, or fame but our sanity — we want to make sure there is meaning behind what we do[^6];
- How to solicit validation and feedback:
  - Share your findings in public and have a conversation[^10];
  - Even a failure is an accomplishment[^7];

## Papers

- Don't be afraid of repeating yourself to get the message crossed[^8];
- Be mindful of reviewing bias — what has been established will be harder to challenge[^9];
