# Plans Versus Workflows

Highlights: [[How to Take Smart Notes]]

Plans are rigid and require careful designs of next steps and goals. They are ill-suited for open-ended research or writing projects. It is often **goal-oriented** and fails to include the steps or actual work to be taken.

You simply cannot plan insights or new ideas.

On the contrary, workflows/systems grant us the autonomy to work on what is right at that moment and encourage new ideas. It reduces the friction of writing by design, such that we don't need much mental energy to power through anything.

A workflow is a combination of tools ([[20220704161251|The Slip-box System]]) and knowledge on how to use them.

## Planners Versus Experts

Planners finish a project and move on. But experts don't stop. Note-taking or learning is a life-long mission that no experts would ever want to stop doing.

Academic writing is an art, and is about gaining insights and making it public. You cannot achieve this by planning. [[How to Take Smart Notes#^ref-32986]]
