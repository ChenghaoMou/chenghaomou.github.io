# Plans Versus Workflows

Highlights: [[31554993|How to Take Smart Notes]]

By definition, a workflow is a combination of tools ([[20220704161251|The Slip-box System]]) and knowledge of how to use them, while a plan is usually a set of goals and steps.

Plans, with their rigid structures and no matter how carefully designed goals and steps, are ill-suited for open-ended research and writing projects. They lack the inherent ingredients for insights or ideas that cannot be planned.

On the contrary, workflows/systems grant us the autonomy to work on what is right at that moment and encourage new ideas. By design, they reduce the friction of writing, so we don't need much mental energy to power through anything with diminishing motivation or interest.

Writing projects like academic writing are an art about gaining insights and making it public. You cannot achieve this by planning.

## Planners Versus Experts

While some planners finish a project and move on, experts don't stop because they understand the value of the continuous pursuit of knowledge via note-taking. To them, note-taking or learning becomes a life-long mission that they want to commit to.
