# Dunning-Kruger Effect and Imposter Syndrome

Highlights: [[31554993|How to Take Smart Notes]]

The **Dunning-Kruger effect** refers to when people who know little about their limitations feel more confident, while people who do often underestimate their abilities. Similarly, high achievers often feel incompetent because they are more aware of the vast knowledge and skills beyond themselves, which is also referred to as **Imposter Syndrome**.

However, there is a contradictory view regarding experience: It can lead to [[20230101110239|Overconfidence]]. For example, experienced managers often overestimate their leadership effectiveness[^1].

One possible explanation is external circumstances. The constant feeling of incompetence can be motivating, like the sword of Damocles, pushing us to always be prepared. But staying in our comfort zone for too long can replace this vigilance with complacency, leading to misjudgment. Thus, it's not hard to imagine a fine line between self-criticism, self-awareness and grandiosity.
