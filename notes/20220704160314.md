# How to Start Taking Notes Smartly

Highlights: [[31554993|How to Take Smart Notes]]

It is not about what is in your notes right now, nor how you were taking notes before. It is about making efforts to change your way of taking notes from now on and "deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them".

As described in [[31554998|Atomic Habits]], you fall to the level of your systems. This is the case with slip boxes.

It is easy to fall back to your old habits of taking notes, but [[20220704161251|The Slip-box System]] prescribed in this book would make a huge difference if you keep doing it (a.k.a. forming a habit). You have to trust the system so that you can start focusing on tackling tasks instead of worrying about note-taking itself.
