# Multilingual Data Filtering

Highlights: [[Henderson et al_2022_Pile of Law]] [@henderson_2022](zotero://select/items/@henderson_2022)

It is difficult to perform data filtering with consistency and transparency because the content can be very situational and culture-dependent. Laws and regulations, in this case, are often the lower bound of the trade-off spectrum of transparency and privacy.

Some universally recognized practices regarding personal sensitive information:
1. No juvenile records
2. No financial information (account numbers, identity numbers, or date of birth)
3. Even if the information is public available, we should not lower our standards

However, not all cases of toxic content are deemed undesired unanimously. *Mentions of toxic language* or *historical quotations* where discrimination was prevalent and therefore considered to be acceptable at that time can be of value to understand the progress of toxicity in a **temporal context**.

## Issues with Modern Language Models

**Context limit:** Text such as mentions or quotations, if substantially long, can be modeled unintentionally as **direct usage** and therefore compromise the training.

**Toxicity in long documents**: longer context dilutes the toxicity according to some recent toxicity language models, suggesting we need a better modeling process.

## Learning the Rules with Language Models

With the Pile of Law dataset, we can teach the model about when to redact names by using masked names/pseudonyms.
