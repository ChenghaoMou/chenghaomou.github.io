# Only Writing Counts

Highlights: [[31554993|How to Take Smart Notes]]

Writing is the only time-tested process to flush out our ideas and thoughts. Spending time on writing doesn't mean less time for reading or learning[^1] [^2]. On the contrary, it is writing that encourages us **to ponder**, **to reason**, and **to be selective about what to write and how to write**[^3] [^4] [^5]. As a side effect, writing can also help you learn concepts better by enforcing you to articulate repeatedly [[20240905154752|Art is about Agency]].

During the process of writing, an idea can only be clearly stated if you understand it first. Even more so, to write it in public, the thought of having someone else to read and criticise your work only makes it more involving and rewarding. It becomes a self-reflection and self-exploration journey with yourself and assumed audience.

**(Re)writing, thinking, and learning** are an inseparable trio.

This is also echoed in [[Students Depend on ChatGPT for Final Exams]], where students take advantage of a text synthesiser for their essays. Even the simple usage of touching up or paraphrasing deprives us of the chance to think and make efforts in general and, consequentially, our desire to learn. This undercuts the fundamental idea of education. Sometimes, such edits can lead to content degradation if left unchecked[^6].

Another area that the LLMs have impacted is books, especially with online bookstores, and those who have the power to protect us from reading books produced with little to no effort aren't doing anything meaningful either[^7].

Of course, this applies to other forms of expressions as well. It is often not the utterances (words in particular order) that matter, but the eagerness to communicate and the actual idea conveyed. Consequentially, passive learning through simply reading or listening to books or lectures can never compete with [[20231206213457|Reading with Cognitive Models]].
