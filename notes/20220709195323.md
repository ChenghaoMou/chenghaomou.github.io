# Only Writing Counts

Highlights: [[How to Take Smart Notes]]

![[How to Take Smart Notes#^ref-45883]]
Writing is the only time-tested medium to flush out our ideas and thoughts. Spending time on writing doesn't mean less time for reading or learning[^1] [^2]. On the contrary, it is writing that encourages us **to ponder** and **to be selective about what to write and how to write**[^3]. During the process of writing, an idea can only be clearly stated if you understand it first. In short, **writing, thinking, and learning** are an inseparable trio.

This is also echoed in [[Students Depend on ChatGPT for Final Exams]] where students are taking advantage of a text synthesizer for their essays. Even the simple usage of touching up or paraphrasing deprives us of the chance of thinking and making efforts in general, and consequentially, our desire to learn. This undercuts the fundamental idea of education. In some cases, such edits can also lead to degradation of the content, if left unchecked[^4].

Of course, this applies to other forms of expressions as well. It is often not the utterances (words in particular order) but the eagerness to communicate or express, and the actual idea conveyed that matters.
