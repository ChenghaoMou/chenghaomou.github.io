# Margin-based Cosine Similarity Metric

Cosine similarity suffers from scale inconsistency[^1], and therefore a margin-based similarity metric is preferred[^1].

$$
\textit{xsim}(x, y) = \textit{margin}(\cos(x, y), \sum_{z \in NN_{k}(x)}\frac{\cos(x, z)}{2k} + \sum_{z \in NN_{k}(y)}\frac{\cos(y, z)}{2k})
$$

Here $NN_k$ means nearest neighbors in the other language/domain, and $\textit{margin}$ can be many options, but $\textit{margin}(a, b) = a - b$ is used in [^1].
