# When Zettelkasten Fails

Even though Zettelkasten is organized bottom-up and free from typical top-down organizational issues, it can suffer from being too noisy or being too little to work with.

## Being Too Noisy

When you have countless ideas in notes that are unprocessed, or processed indiscriminately, you can hardly find the relevant information or have meaningful encounters with your notes. The slip-box loses its edge over a generic search engine.

If you only write notes related to current projects, your notes become obsolete as soon as you finish your projects.

There is no need to write everything down, as we don't cram everything into our brain. Only if it can help you with your thinking, you write a note about it.
