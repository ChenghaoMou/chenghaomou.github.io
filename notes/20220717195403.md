# Word and Novelty

Reference: [[-Disregard the Words-|Disregard the Words]]

- Words often escape us when we try to describe something truly unique and novel
- Describing something with words is an abstraction just like programming. To learn the reality thoroughly one need to disregard the words that are used to describe it.
