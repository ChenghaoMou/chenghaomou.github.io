# Early Exiting

A popular strategy of [[20210926153300|Adaptive Computation]]. In the transformer language model family, the exiting strategy is often related to the **number of layers** involved. There are several challenges when adopting this technique:
1. What confidence measure to use;
2. Performance constraints;

Examples of early exiting include [[Schuster et al_2022_Confident Adaptive Language Modeling]].
