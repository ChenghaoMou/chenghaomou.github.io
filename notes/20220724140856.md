# Model Soup

Source [^1][^2]

Model soup refers to averaging multiple fine-tuned models' weights to a new model. It is shown that such practice improves the performance and robustness.

## Model Soups VS. Ensemble

Model soup is more straightforward than model ensembling and highly correlates to it as well.

## Uniform Averaging and Greedy Soup

The authors have shown a greedy soup can have even better performance than a uniform average. By adding a model only when it improves the fine-tune task, greedy soup ignores models that does not contribute to the task. Such models might reside in different loss basins.
