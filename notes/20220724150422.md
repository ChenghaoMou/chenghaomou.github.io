ML-based Compilers

Compared to traditional [[20210926153100#^a1f1b9|Machine Learning Compilers and Optimizers]], ML-based compilers use machine learning to optimize the graph compilation. Examples of such compilers are:
- cuDNN
- autoTVM

It's a viable alternative to hand-designed optimizations for new hardware products or frameworks, but it can also be very slow due to the vast search space.
