# ML-based Compilers

Unlike traditional [[20210926153100|Machine Learning Compilers and Optimizers]], ML-based compilers use machine learning to optimize the graph compilation. Examples of such compilers are cuDNN and autoTVM.

It's a viable alternative to hand-designed optimizations for new hardware products or frameworks, but it can also be very slow due to the vast search space.
