# Multitasking

Highlights: [[31554993|How to Take Smart Notes]]

People often feel more productive when multitasking, but it is not. Both the quantity and the quality of the work are decreased. Like multitasking in computer science, it is essentially quick context-switching, and our brain works even less efficiently than computer multicore chips [^1]. Externally, the overwhelming information and distractions around us make focusing on one thing more difficult[^2]. (Will AI make it better or worse?)

Writing is a collection of tasks, in the sense that it includes "reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting". But none of these require parallel processing.

Accepting the truth that we are not good at multitasking and the fact that we have endless things on our plate forces us to say no. It also forces us to reflect on our priorities and to realise that the promising land of finishing is never around the corner[^3] [^4].
