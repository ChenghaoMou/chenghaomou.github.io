# Connection

Connection is the key to our understanding and internalization. Such connections can be "rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations". [[31554993|How to Take Smart Notes]]

When the right connections are made, and a proper cue is given, we can retrieve information from our memory/knowledge.

> You shall know a word by the company it keeps (Firth, J. R. 1957:11)

By the same logic, a note is only as valuable as the connections it keeps.

Making connections among notes can be time-consuming and energy draining â€” because you are making sense of the material over and over again, but it will become more and more enjoyable as the slip box grows towards a critical mass, by which time, adding connections is essentially a process of learning itself.
