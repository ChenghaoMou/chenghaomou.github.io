# Confirmation Bias

Highlights: [[31554993|How to Take Smart Notes]]
References: [[31554987|Think Again]]

We see what we expect to see, and our instincts are not helping[^1]. It means we tend to prefer things that are more familiar, more aligned with what we already believe, or more like ourselves.

This is dangerous because we can unconsciously build an echo room with our notes/surroundings, thus eliminating any opportunity for critical insights.

## How to Avoid Confirmation Bias

Have an open mind when taking notes, and choose **relevancy** over familiarity.
