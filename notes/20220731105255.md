# Pruning

Pruning refers to the practice of removing redundant parameters in a neural network. Some examples of pruning are:

1. Magnitude Pruning: pruning parameters based on their magnitude, which can be very different from their importance to downstream tasks.
2. Importance Pruning: pruning parameters based on downstream tasks.

Three considerations when using pruning:
1. which parameters to remove;
2. how to adjust for the removed parameters;
3. how to do this efficiently;
