# Problems with OCR in Document Understanding

Highlights: [[Kim et al_2022_OCR-free Document Understanding Transformer]]

1. Computation cost: Training an OCR model and running it for text detection significantly increases the time and cost for both training and inference.
2. Error propagation: Errors that surface in the OCR results create a bottle for downstream model performance.
3. Generalizability: OCR rarely extends itself to non-Latin scripts and other languages. Free and off-the-shelf OCR engines often produce poorer results than commercial products.
