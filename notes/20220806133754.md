# OCR-free Document Understanding Transformer

Source[^1]

Highlights: [[Kim et al_2022_OCR-free Document Understanding Transformer]]

Including an OCR component in the document understanding system poses [[20220806133205|Problems with OCR in Document Understanding|a series of problems]]. Here, the authors propose a pseudo-OCR encoder-decoder framework, converting all downstream tasks to generation tasks, to get rid of OCR dependency.

One of the metrics they use to measure information extraction results is [[20220806134354|Tree Edit Distance]].
