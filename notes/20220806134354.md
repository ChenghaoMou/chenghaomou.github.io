# Tree Edit Distance

A parsing of a document can be represented as a tree, similar to a DOM tree in an HTML webpage. By measuring the edit distance between the ground truth tree and the predicted parsing tree, one can get a more realistic measure about the similarity with some flexibility.

Specifically, it is measure by the minimum cost of a sequence of operations needed to convert from one tree to another. Operations include deletion, insertion, and renaming.
