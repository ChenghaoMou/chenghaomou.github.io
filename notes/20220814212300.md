# Referent and Reference

Highlights: [[Piantadosi_Hill_2022_Meaning without reference in large language models]]

Referents are physical, tangible objects that we can refer to when using a language. We can conjure up an image of an apple when using the word "Apple". But we do have a large vocabulary that some abstract terms/phrases do not share any physical referents.

Reference is the relation that connects such forms and their referents. [[Three ideas from linguistics that everyone in AI should know#^96620f]]
