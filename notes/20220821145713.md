# Flashcards VS Zettels

Flashcards are **isolated** pieces of information that people often use to cram information into their heads (rote memory without reference). It is good for remembering stuff, but never really for understanding or truly learning them, not to mention writing manuscripts in the end.

This eerily combines the idea of [[20220814212300|Referent]] and [[20220814211819|Meaning and Reference]] â€” connections and references are both important factors in the process of understanding.
