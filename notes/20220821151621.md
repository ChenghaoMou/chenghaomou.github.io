# Restrictions Promote Creativity in Zettelkasten

The [[20220704161251|The Slip-box System]] seems daunting at first, since it requires a lot of deliberate practice, time, and energy during the process. It also requires significant change to how you read, write, and interact with your notes. e.g., one idea per note and one page per note.

Despite such constraints, it is proven to be effective promoting insights because it strips the noises and imposes a simple yet powerful structure to our workflow while leaving enough freedom for comparison, differentiation, and experimentation.
