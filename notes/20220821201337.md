# Permanent Notes

It is one of the three note categorisations in Zettelkasten. This is where ideas or concepts get elaborated in **atomic** details.

Connections are often made among them during transitioning from a [[20220821200532|Fleeting Note]] into a Permanent one. Such connections are the essence of [[20220704161251|The Slip-box System]].

It should include enough context about where it comes from and where it could be used in the future. Both the atomicity and connections should be revisited and updated often to serve our future selves.
