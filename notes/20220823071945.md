# Resist Brainstorming

If building a slip box is the tool for insights, then brainstorming for ideas is just scratching the surface.

In a slip box, we can rely on the connections and materials to find concrete ideas and insights. However, this is not a case for a brainstorm session where the only thing you can come up with is right on your mind.

Admittedly, you might have experience and skills that warrant no explicit supporting evidence, and your brain might work well in some occasions. But a slip box is superior in a sense that it comes with all the content already, if built with enough rumination.

Instead, if we are interested in finding topics to write about, we can turn to our notes for questions that have been asked, discussed, or even answered with supporting [[20220724214948|Connections]]. Questions that are worth answering or exploring, due to the [[20220823073646|Topical Gravity in Zettelkasten]], we can easily find relevant materials to work with.
