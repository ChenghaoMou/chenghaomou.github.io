# Early Token Curse and Sliding Window Evaluation

For a given language model trained with $L$ context length, it is popular to evaluate the model on a corpus using non-overlapping segments using perplexity. However, this does not reflect the real performance of the model. Short context window means more evaluations for a given dataset. And for perplexity evaluation, the starting tokens are the most confusing text for the model because it's starting from nothing. Therefore, **short context leads to more chance of guessing early tokens**.

While using a sliding window, it counterbalances such issue by equalize the numbers of evaluations on early tokens, though it significantly increases the evaluation time.
