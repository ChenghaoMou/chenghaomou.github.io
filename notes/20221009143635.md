# Local Interpretation

A.k.a. pointwise interpretation. It works with individual predictions. This is in direct contrast with [[20221009144221|Global Interpretation]].

Examples of pointwise interpretation methods are:
1. [Counterfactual Explanations](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/counterfactual.html)
2. [Shapley Values](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html)
3. [SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html)

This key difference between local interpretation and global interpretation isn't always clear, since methods can often be used/viewed in both perspectives.
