# Batch Normalization

In contrary to [[20220731103941|Layer Normalization]], batch normalization normalizes the columns/features over a batch of activations.

However, it also means that such normalization is dependent on the batch. One solution to this is that you keep **a running average of mean and variance** for all features at that layer, which are applied during inference.
