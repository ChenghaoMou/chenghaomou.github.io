# Conformal Prediction

Source: [Quantify The Uncertainty Of Predictive Models With Conformal Prediction](https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/quantify-the-uncertainty-of-predictive)

It takes a "heuristic uncertainty score" and converts it into a "rigorous" one, usually by [[20211003180000|Calibration]].

Recipe:
- Split data into training and calibration subsets
- Train model on training data
- Pick a certainty level (e.g. 90%)
- Calculate the heuristic scores on calibration data
- Calibrate the heuristic scores to make them rigorous with guaranteed coverage
- Use calibrated thresholds on new data
