# Meaningful Names

- Just enough context:
	- why it exists
	- what it does
	- how to use it
- Write for your **readers**, not compilers
- Informative > Non-informative > Dis-informative
- Make it pronounceable, so people can discuss it
- Only use single-letter variables in a small local scope
- Consistency lexicon

Choosing a good name for your variable requires good descriptive skills and a shared **cultural background**.
