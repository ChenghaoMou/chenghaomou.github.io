Given a (subject, object, relation) fact:

- **A clean run** uses the original input and calculates the hidden representations.
- **A corrupted run** uses masked input where the subject is masked or obfuscated.
- **A corrputed-with-restoration run** uses the same masked input, but uses the original hidden states at certain layer and certain token/step.

To effectively measure which layer and which step to swap the hidden states, the authors further defined the following metrics:

- **Total Effect**: the probability change from a clean run to a corrupted run. This tells how much impact the subject tokens have over the prediction.
- **Indirect Effect**: the probability change from a corrupted-with-restoration run to a corrupted run. This tells how much impact the restoration (at layer $l$ and token/step $i$) has over the prediction.

Takeaways: ^9eca9d
- In terms of restoration layer, $l$ should be in the eraly-to-middle MLP modules.
- In terms of restoration step/token, $i$ should be the last subject token.
