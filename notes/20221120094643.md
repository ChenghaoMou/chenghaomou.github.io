# Compositionality

A complex whole can be "systematically interpreted in terms of their parts, and how these parts are arranged"[^1].

Similar to most NLP questions, to **solve** it requires understanding, which we, as humans, still don't have an accurate metric for. Even if we have a colossal array of benchmarks, it is a proxy that can only prove generalized usefulness or applicability at best.
