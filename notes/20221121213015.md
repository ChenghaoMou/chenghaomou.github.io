# Folk Interface

From [[20221231183257|Folk Interfaces]]. It describes when people repurpose an existing software to their own use-cases that are unexpected by the original creators of the software.

People's creativity and willpower to shape things to their liking never stop to amaze me. The insatiability for a better solution (a.k.a. too lazy to be burdened with inefficiency) resonates so well with my inner perfectionism. Yet, the **folk** part conveys something that is almost crude yet effective.
