# Folk Interface

From [[Folk Interfaces|Folk Interfaces]]. It describes when people repurpose an existing software to their own use cases that are unexpected by the original creators of the software.

People's creativity and willpower to shape things to their liking never stop to amaze me. The insatiability for a better solution (a.k.a. too lazy to be burdened with inefficiency) resonates so well with my inner perfectionism. Yet, the **folk** part conveys something that is almost crude yet effective.
