# Importance of Reading and Writing

1. Writing isn't just translation from thoughts to words. It also allows us to think about what we are trying to express. Note-taking while reading, in particular, is one of the most effective techniques recommended in [[How to Take Smart Notes]]. ([[20220709195323|Only Writing Counts]], [[20220717133315|Writing with a Positive Feedback Loop]], [[20220730154644|Importance of Note-taking When Reading]])
2. Reading, on the other hand, is our way of perceiving such expression, to learn, to understand different abstractions, and to discover new insights. ([[Reading Ourselves to Death]], [[The Need to Read]], [[20220830210545|Tyler Cowen on Reading]])
3. Both reading and writing are our thoughtful mediums of communication that can inspire personal growth, and meaningful connections[^1] [^2].
4. But there should be no shortcut, see [[Students Depend on ChatGPT for Final Exams]]. There is a difference when knowing how to use a calculator and only knowing how to use a calculator. We should take reasonability for and control of our words, instead of letting the model take the wheel.

It is also worth mentioning that what we read also matters[^3].
