# Slow and Deep Thinking

![[Iâ€™m a very slow thinker]]

We don't need to rush our conversations. By thinking slowly, we put more deliberation and thoughtfulness into our communication.

Do people have an expectation of immediate response in the modern real-time communication framework? This reminds me of [[Deep Work#^ref-45583]], [[Deep Work#^ref-57797]]. The same reason we need [[Deep Work]], we also need deep thinking in our conversations.
