# Natural Language Versus Code

Reference: [[Notebook on nbviewer]] [[Notebook]]

The encoder-decoder transformer, along with pretraining with large data, was designed for natural language, where no rigid linguistic rules can directly apply ([[Notebook on nbviewer#^853f3f]]). This is not the case for code. There are rules that don't change over different cultures, locations, or backgrounds.

Coding challenges are often variations of a small subset of algorithms, but real-world problems are much more complex, especially viewed end-to-end.

We need a better UX around interactions with large generative models that are embedded in various systems, which are constantly evolving ([[Notebook on nbviewer#^abe0ed]]). In a coding environment, a small change would impact the whole program. How can we design a system that can help adapt to such changes?
