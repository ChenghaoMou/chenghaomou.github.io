# Natural Language Versus Code

Reference: [[Notebook on nbviewer|AlphaCode]]

The encoder-decoder transformer and pretraining with large data were designed for natural language, where no rigid linguistic rules can directly apply. This is not the case for code. Some rules don't change over different cultures, locations, or backgrounds.

Coding challenges are often variations of a small subset of algorithms, but real-world problems are much more complex, especially when viewed end-to-end.

We need a better UX around interactions with large generative models that are embedded in various systems, which are constantly evolving. In a coding environment, a small change would impact the whole program. How can we design a system that can help adapt to such changes?
