# Abstract Meaning Representation

Source: [Abstract Meaning Representation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Meaning_Representation)

AMR is a semantic representation language that forms a DAG that is rooted and labeled. An example:

```
# The body wants to go.
(w / want-01
	:arg0 (b / boy)
	:arg1 (g / go-01
		:arg0 b
	)
)
```

The goal of such representation is that similar sentences should have the same AMR.

- This favors English language.
- It requires a parser and is slow.

## AMR Metrics

The representation covers different semantic aspects that are called AMR metrics, allowing a finer depiction of semantic similarity, such as coreference, negation, entities, or events.
