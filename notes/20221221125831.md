# Information Transparency

It's a double sword. On one hand, transparent and free access to information allows us fact-checking statements from any source and hold them accountable. On another hand, such information might violate people's privacy[^1].

But it must do not have to be mutually exclusive. Can we build a privacy-preserving information system to allow legitimate access while warding off bad actors? What are the possible ways to prevent data reverse-engineering? Only a handful of people travel with private jets, for example, it should not be a difficult job to trace back their owners with all the public information (job locations and events).
