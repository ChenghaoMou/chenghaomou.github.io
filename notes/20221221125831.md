# Information Transparency

It's a double sword. On the one hand, transparent and free access to information allows us to fact-check statements from any source and hold them accountable. On the other hand, such information might violate people's privacy[^1].

But it must not have to be mutually exclusive. Can we build a privacy-preserving information system to allow legitimate access while warding off bad actors? What are the possible ways to prevent data reverse-engineering? E.g. only a handful of people travel with private jets, so it should not be a difficult job to trace back their owners with all the public information (job locations and events).
