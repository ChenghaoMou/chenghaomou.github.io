# Call It What It Is

AI is an umbrella term that we constantly add new things that we don't understand and remove old things as soon as we find them less attractive. [[Empty Pointers and Constellations of AI]]

Using philosophically loaded words such as "know", "understand", "answer", "think", and "hallucinate" when describing a model[^1], and allowing it to synthesise sentences beginning with "I" take advantage of our tendency to familiarise/humanise and make sense of things. [[20230305142934|Anthropomorphizing AI]]

We should refrain from using those terms before the public has common knowledge about how those models work[^2] [^3].

Getting good results on some benchmarks, or responding well to some magic prompts offers too much temptation to assume human-like reasoning capabilities[^4].
