# Call It What It is

AI is an umbrella term that we constantly add new things that we don't understand and remove old things as soon as we found it less attractive. [[Empty Pointers and Constellations of AI]]

Using philosophically loaded words such as "know", "understand", "answer", "think", and "hallucinate" when describing a model[^1], and allowing it to synthesize sentences beginning with "I" take advantage of our tendency to familiarize/humanize and make sense of things.

We should refrain from using those terms before the public has the commonsense knowledge about how those models work ([[shanahan_2022#^e619d4]], [[shanahan_2022#^e5fb4b]]).

Getting good results on some benchmarks, or responds well to some magic prompts, offer too much temptation to assume human-like reasoning capabilities. ([[shanahan_2022#^d03d2c]])
