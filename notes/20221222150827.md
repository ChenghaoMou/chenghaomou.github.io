# Language Generation

Current text generation is one very specific type of sampling: Given a piece of text, based on the training data statistics, what is the most likely continuation[^1]?

Calling the model's generation with words like "answer", "reply", or "respond" is overly anthropomorphic ([[20221222135352|Call It What It is]], [[20230305142934|Anthropomorphizing AI]]).

Even if the model is more aligned with human values (e.g., reinforcement learning), it does not change the nature of the generation[^1].
