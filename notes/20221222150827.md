# Language Generation

Innately, the current generation is a very specific kind of sampling: Given a piece of text, based on the training data statistics, what is the most likely continuation[^1]?

Calling the model's generation with words like "answer", "reply", or "respond" is overly anthropomorphic ([[20221222135352|Call It What It is]]).

Even if the model is more aligned with human values (e.g. reinforced learning), it does not change the very nature of the model[^1].
