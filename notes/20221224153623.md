# Risk and Fear

Risk and fear are crucial components in our personal growth, the lack of which creates a bubble filled with boredom that gives us a false sense of security[^1].

Call it whatever you want, [[Staring into the abyss as a core life skill|staring into the abyss]], [[20220604131222|imagining the worst]], facing the problem, facing the unpleasant[^2], or getting out of our comfort zone; what is important is that we need to make conscious steps to build a virtuous loop by taking the risk:

1. **Acknowledge the current situation and issues**. We might realize that we have wasted too much time working on a terrible project, being in a bad relationship, or keep making career choices we know you don't like. We might also realize that we have been procrastinating to think about it for a long time, mostly because that would deplete our mental energy already running low.
2. **Make time and think about it**. Some good questions that can help you get some inner clarity on those questions[^3] :
	* If you had to leave your job today, what would you do instead? What’s the best argument in favour of doing that right now?
	* If you have a partner, what’s the best argument in favour of breaking up with them?
	* Are there ways you behave that you wish you didn’t? What unacknowledged desires could be driving those?
	* What have you said “yes” to that you wouldn’t say “hell yes” to?
	* Is there something you “should” do that you’re not currently doing? Why?
	* What bad things are you afraid of happening? Imagine in detail what it would be like if they happened.
	* What do you need that you’re not currently getting?
	* What are you avoiding because it conflicts with some part of your identity/self-image?
	* What is the biggest thing in your life that you just kind of casually fell into, and would you have made a conscious decision to do it if you’d known in advance everything you know now?
3. **Act**. ([[20220604131222|Premeditatio Malorum]])

Be aware of the percentage of risk-taking activities you make in your life. You want to avoid spending all your time contemplating every decision you make, but you also don't want to live a life without any depth.
