# Lovelace Test

The Lovelace Test is a test designed for [[20221231140035|Computational Creativity]]. The test covers three criterions:

1. An agent $a$, designed by a human $h$, outputs $o$;
2. Such outputting process can be repeated constantly;
3. A judge ($h$ or someone with equal knowledge) cannot explain how $a$ produced $o$;

## Lovelace Test 2.0

Proposed in [[riedl_2014]], it follows:

1. An agent $a$, designed by a human $h$, outputs $o$ of type $t$ (music, painting, writing etc.);
2. $o$ must conform to a set of constraints $C$, each of which is expressed in natural language;
3. Having chosen $t$ and $C$, a human evaluator $h$ is satisfied that $o$ is a valid instance of $t$ that meets $C$. (There is an element of surprise when the agent passes, since the evaluator has been given the chance to device $C$ to disprove the intelligence)
4. A human referee $r$ (expert in $t$) determines that the combination of $t$ and $C$ is realistic within average human abilities.

You can repeat the test with more or harder constraints to test its limits. There is no absolute threshold or stop in the testing that certifies intelligence, but it offers us the lens through which we can compare different agents **quantitatively**.
