# Overconfidence

<p class="sidenote">How can we evaluate models based on merits?</p>

People favor overconfidence due to a concept known as evolutionary mismatch[^1][^2]. This also explains why we are seeing more and more hyped model releases, which potentially in return attract more funding for them in the future.

It is also shown that, in addition to sexism, men are more willing to become avid users of such over-confident language[^1].

If a higher score on an IQ test means more likely to fall for stereotypes[^3], how can we escape? Can we fight against our blindness to our weaknesses? Does this relate to the aging of our brain[^4] [^5]?
