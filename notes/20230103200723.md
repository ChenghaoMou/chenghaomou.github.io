# Content Replication

Source: [[somepalli_2022|Diffusion Art or Digital Forgery? Investigating Data Replication in Diffusion Models]]

Content replication refers to the reproduction of training content, often with complete verbatim information or minor modification. Such replication has implications both ethically and legally because it is unclear for now how those generated content can be considered fair use or stealing. The lack of attribution from the model also makes it more problematic.

Other contributing factors include large data collection, mismatched with little data curation oversight and analysis, as well as memorizing abilities (overfitting) present in large models[^1].

It is found that models trained on small datasets are more likely to regurgitate training data than large models. However, this is unlikely an exemption for blindless scaling because the method used in @somepalli_2022[^2] has its limitations.
