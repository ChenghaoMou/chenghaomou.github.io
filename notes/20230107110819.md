# Ethical Considerations for Artificial Intelligence Applications

To meaningfully engage in ethical conversations regarding AI applications, it is important to understand a few ethical frameworks, such as [[20230107135810|Consequentialism]], [[20230107140411|Duty Ethics]], [[20230107140307|Utilitarianism]], such that we can approach problems in a more systematic way.

When discussing autonomous application deployment, it is critical to maintain the chain of command, e.g., [[20230107141241|Attribution of Responsibility]], where a human can be held accountable for their decisions and actions.

We yet to have a satisfactory answer to all the questions involved, but we should nonetheless commit enough efforts for our due diligence. On the plus, we do have some concepts we can apply during the discussion, such as [[20230107143218|Informed Consent]] and [[20230107142551|Meaningful Human Control]] for different domains like medicine or autonomous weapon systems.

Ethical topics:

1. Privacy and data protection;
2. Domain expertise;
3. Transparency and explainability;
4. Cost and benefits, which are often measured in terms of money values, but in reality the values cannot be directly measured, especially social and moral values in different contexts and cultures. Problems such as [[20230108125601|Greenwashing]] and [[20230108125736|Ethical Hacking]] can arise when implementation isn't transparent.

Above are useful questions to ask when deploying AI applications, but when deciding to build one, a different set of questions can be asked in stead ([[20220925095941|Ethical Questions to Ask in AI]]).
