# Attribution of Responsibility

Attribution of Responsibility questions who should take responsibility in the case of damages and harms to people or goods. This is an important factor in an ethic conversation, regardless of the frameworks ([[20230107140411|Duty Ethics]], [[20230107135810|Consequentialism]]).

The rapid development in autonomous applications only makes it harder to answer such question because such autonomous intelligence cuts off the command chain, independent of any human intervention or control based on the [[20230107140411|Duty Ethics]] standpoint. It can be argued in both ways from the [[20230107135810|Consequentialism]] perspective that such automation is less labor-intensive and more efficient without any emotional interference, but also lack of humanitarian considerations, common sense, or human-level flexibility. Additionally, the long-term consequences aren't always easy to predict. Such is the case of LLMs ([[20221210185344|On the Dangers of Large Generative Models]]), so the concept of [[20230107142551|Meaningful Human Control]] has been proposed here to remedy such dilemma.
