# Meaningful Human Control

Human controllers should have enough time and information to intervene on the autonomous systems, to sustain the command chain, and to take on the responsibility of any actions or decisions as an embodied agent.

However, this prioritizes the regulations (what should we do with such systems) over definitions (why and how should we design such systems).
