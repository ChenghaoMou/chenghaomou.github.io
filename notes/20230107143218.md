# Informed Consent

It is a specific principle in medical ethics, medical law and media studies â€” a patient must have **sufficient information** and **understanding** before making decisions about their medical care. However, this is challenged in the Big Data era because new information can be inferred in ways that traditional informed consenters did not expect.

However, in some cases, incomplete disclosure or some form of deception is required. In this case, the researchers have the responsibility to ensure it is justified and people's rights are protected. Often, a rigorous ethical review is required[^1].
