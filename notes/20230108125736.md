# Ethical Hacking

Hacking, a form of violation of cybersecurity, with a pro-social goal.

Common goals used by ethical hacking advocates:

## Information Should Be Free, without Cost and without Restriction

Counterargument: If everything is free, there wouldn't be any market for information, and therefore no motivation of information production.

## It Reveals System Vulnerabilities

Counterargument: There are proper ways for this (e.g., pen testing) with [[20230107143218|Informed Consent]].

## No Harm is Done

Counterargument: The violation of privacy can be dangerous by itself.

## It Reveals Unethical Abuses, Usually From the Government

Counterargument: Yes, it might, but is this the only resort?
