# Ethical Issues with AI Art

Questions like "which is by a human and which is by a model" are missing the point. The framing of these questions are equating the artistic expression and desire behind the work to nothing. A better question to ask would be "which is by a human who has desires to communicate, to express, and to inspire and which is by a model trained on data gathered without [[20230107143218|Informed Consent]] with a goal to synthesis without proper attribution"[^3].

As with other generative models[^4], the process of generation, though seemingly impressive, is largely uncontrollable and unreliable in terms of data replication[^1] and attribution[^2] with a plethora of issues in other aspects[^4].
