# Authorship

- Generative models are tools. The same reason we don't credit Python for all the models we built, or all the grammar mistakes fixed by Grammarly, we should not credit a writing assistant[^1].
- Additionally, they do not have the scientific skill sets to reliably contribute to the paper in any meaningful way. If you think the contribution is "significant" to any extent, then it is basically telling reviewers and readers that the paper is worthless[^1].
- It is really problematic and concerning to credit a tool when it cannot even credit properly for its generation.
