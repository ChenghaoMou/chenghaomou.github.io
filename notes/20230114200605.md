# Bitter Lessons in X Engineering

Let X be software, machine learning, or data.

It involves a lot more things than coding. It could be dealing with data and numbers to figure out patterns and features. Moreover, it could be writing documentation and PRDs. Likewise, it could be spending hours in meetings just to figure out what our dear PMs want[^1]. And the impact or value you create can also extend beyond the code you produce[^2].

Document it when you can and when you can remember. You will thank yourself later[^2].

Communication is rarely clear from the get-go. It is your job to disentangle it[^2].

Meetings are part of the job, so start to treat it like a coding challenge and learn how to make it more efficient and productive[^2].
