# Pastiche

Synthesizing things together in a style that **imitates** that of other artists or work.[^1]

This word might still give too much credit to a model when talking about [[20230114155552|AI Art]] as the model has no intention to imitate in the first place. There should be a word that describes such generation/synthesis, or be created, so that the general audience can have a better understanding of what is happening behind the curtain, and AI-bros can be disillusioned with the idea that we are on the right track of AGI.
