# Being Ready

Life doesn't support do-over. People who make resolutions at new year's don't really get a fresh start. Life moves on, constantly, when you are not ready most of the time.

![[3-2-1- One of the most valuable skills in life, and starting before you feel ready#^b13b9e]]

How can we move forward being unprepared? Accept the fact that we will never be ready, and work with what we've got[^1]. The same applies to building software â€” it will never be perfect. What matters, in the end, is that you ship, continuously and incrementally.

Certainly, there is this [[20221224153623|fear]] of failure, but we have to take the risk[^2]. Another remedy is to imagine [[What if you never sort your life out-|What if you never sort your life out?]]

Even worse, we never know if our demise is around the corner. We don't need a near-death experience to tell us that we still have time to prepare, to worry, and to care too much.
