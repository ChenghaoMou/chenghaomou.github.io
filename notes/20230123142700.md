# The Rat Race

There is a similar concept called Involution, started circa 2020 in China, which is often used to describe a toxic work environment filled with meaningless competitions.

Being an engineer in the tech industry, this feeling of insignificance and lack of fulfillment are particularly common. People are talking about [[Quitting the Rat Race]], or lying flat[^1]. But if everyone is busying participating in the rat race or busying lying flat, who can we trust to question the system or to revolutionize the game?
