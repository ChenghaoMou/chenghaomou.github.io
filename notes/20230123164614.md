If the end goal of an AI is to serve humans, then the first order of the business should be to understand humans. To understand humans, you cannot limit your view to only a few lenses from Computer Science, which, to be frank, focuses more on machines than humans. Similarly, CS majors should not be the sole governor or arbitrator of such a system when humanity is at stake[^1] [^2].

It is eerily unsettling that people want to build models solely from large data as badly as they want a solution to solve all problems purely from a computational approach. It already starts to show that the current CS curriculum is insufficient in terms of ethical and moral education[^3], and other fields, just as Computer Science, including the funds behind them, are not as diversified as they should be.
