# Being Human

In the [[The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI|expanding Dark Forest]] of the Internet, generative AIs can easily create waves of profit-oriented content that conceals the truth and genuine desires for human connections. Thus, it is important to remain, reinforce, and boost signals of our humanity, as well as to be on the lookout for that of other people.

[[In the Age of A I , Major in Being Human]] outlines several core aspects that we should pay attention to when fostering our unique humanness:

1. Develop a unique voice through [[20221127140633|Reading and Writing]]. It is true that some models can copy a writing or drawing style, but it can never copy our mind, our personal experience, and our unique perspectives that go into the writing. It is also true that such uniqueness shape our situational awareness and decision-making process[^1].
2. Develop a strategic mindset that transcends a single task. Models can do some tasks reasonably well, but they never understand the life goals we would have when tackling problems. In the article, presentation skill is one example. When giving a speech on a certain topic, our goal isn't simply talk through some slides, instead we are communicating with the audience in a shared context. It requires much planning and engagement that no modern-day models can complete on their own.
3. Develop empathy. Not everything has to be pragmatically computational. Humanities proliferate in domains beyond computer science, like literature, drama, biography, and history. But be careful, [[Human-like programs abuse our empathy - even Google engineers arenâ€™t immune]].
