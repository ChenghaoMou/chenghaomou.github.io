# Vigilance

A cognitive term to describe people's attention for long periods of time. It has shown that it starts to dwindle after half an hour[^1].

In the case of assisted driving systems, Google learned that human-in-the-loop cannot be trusted as people's attention will eventually wander, and they tend to trust systems too quickly and too easily. That's why they moved away from assistant driving to human-free driving[^1].
