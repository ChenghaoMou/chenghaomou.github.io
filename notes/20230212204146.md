# AI Democratization

Reference: [[What Do We Mean When We Talk About “AI Democratisation”-|What Do We Mean When We Talk About “AI Democratisation”?]]

## Use

This is often the default case when people talk about democratizing AI: people, developers or not, can use such models or services, with paid API access.

But this use-case is also the most hyped in marketing, where the word implicitly becomes a synonym of capitalization. The underlying assumption for this type of democratisation is that you have enough resources to afford such use, and knowledge and access to such APIs or compute in the first place[^1].

Futhermore, labor can be displaced or taken advantage of by such prevail use while having no oppotunity to say no or catch up[^2] [^3].

## Development

Having access to the design and development processes of a model.

## Benefits

Distributing benefits or profits generated by AI products more equitably.

## Governance

Distributing influence over model-related decisions to a broader community of stakeholders.

But strangely, the responsibility and enforcement are frequently overlooked and understated. The governance is often limited to the ones who enjoy the riches and are kind enough to pretend to worry about some distant future doomsday risks[^4].
