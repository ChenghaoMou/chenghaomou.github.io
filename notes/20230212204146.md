# AI Democratization

Reference: [[What Do We Mean When We Talk About “AI Democratisation”|What Do We Mean When We Talk About “AI Democratisation”?]]

## Use

This is often the default case when people talk about democratizing AI: people, developers or not, can use such models or services, with a paid API access or not.

But this use-case is also the most hyped in marketing, where the word implicitly becomes a synonym of capitalization.

## Development

Having access to the design and development processes of a model.

## Benefits

Distributing benefits or profits generated by AI products more equitably.

## Governance

Distributing influence over model-related decisions to a wider community of stakeholders.

But strangely, the responsibility and enforcement are often overlooked.
