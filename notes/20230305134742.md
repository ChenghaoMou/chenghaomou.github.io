# Copyright of AI Generation

AI models cannot bear [[20230114195045|Human Authorship]][^1], and their generations cannot be copyrighted.

The problem is that the training data is typically unethically collected, and the generation process can potentially regurgitate training elements without any attribution to the original content creators[^2]. It will be much more difficult to claim copyright when you can't efficiently check for plagiarism or trace the source of "inspiration". It also places this burden on the users to prove their human efforts that went into generation[^1].
