# A New Definition of Luddism

Luddite or luddism are still used as pejorative terms to insult people.

The truth is that those Luddites were, and now modern Neo Luddites are, never against technology. Instead, it is the destructive capitalism behind those machines that had led to the movement. Those machines weren't even new inventions, and not all of them were destroyed indiscriminately. The Luddites acted on those machines whose owners had questionable business practices[^1].

One of the new Luddism's goals is to "confront harms done by digital capitalism and see to address them by giving people more power over the technological systems that structure their lives"[^1], which I find very similar to what people are striving for in AI community, talking about [[20230212204146|AI Democratization]], especially among all the hyped up model releases.
