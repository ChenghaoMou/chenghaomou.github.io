# A New Definition of Luddism

Luddite or Luddism is still used as pejorative terms to insult people.

The truth is that those Luddites were, and now modern neo-Luddites are, never against technology. Instead, it’s the destructive capitalism behind those machines that had led to the movement. Those machines weren't even brand-new inventions; not all were demolished indiscriminately. The Luddites acted on those machines whose owners conducted questionable business practices[^1].

Luckily, the tide is changing: more and more individuals are embracing the term with a widened scope — the ability to reassess how tech is serving us[^2]. One of the new Luddism's objectives is to "confront harms done by digital capitalism and see to address them by giving humans more power over the technological systems that structure their lives"[^1], which I find very similar to what people are striving for in AI community, talking about [[20230212204146|AI Democratization]], especially among all the hyped-up model releases.

The goal of the new Luddite movement isn’t merely being customers or users of technology, but shapers too[^2].
