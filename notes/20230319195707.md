# Fear of AI

We are not really against AI or technology development[^1] [^2]. Our fear is mostly about "how capitalism or people in power will use the technology against us"[^3] [^4] [^5] [^6] [^7] [^8].

Free and fancy demos will always end, then it is always about money making. Even when it is free, it is problematic; how can we expect it to be any better when it is behind a paywall?

Putting models or services aside, because we still haven't see the promising land through the hype, we are already in a trench dug by the exploitive privacy policies where users might have already paid with their money and labor (telemetries and feedbacks) and now they also have to pay with their data[^9].
