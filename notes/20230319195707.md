# Fear of AI

We are not really against AI or technology development[^1]. Our fear is mostly about "how capitalism will use technology against us"[^2] [^3] [^4] [^5] [^6]. Free and fancy demos will always end, then it is about money making. Even when it is free, it is problematic[^7]; how can we expect it to be any better when it is behind a paywall?
