# Fear of AI

We are not really against AI[^1], the fear we have is mostly about "how capitalism will use technology against us"[^2]. Free and fancy demos will always end, then it is about money making. Even when it is free, it is problematic[^3], how can we expect it to be any better when it is behind a paywall?
