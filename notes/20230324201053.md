# First-instinct Fallacy

This term came from a study that found students got better scores when changed their first-instinct answer[^1] [^2]. But carrying out this change won't be easy due to our cognitive laziness. The idea of doubting ourselves feels insecure, and occasionally, it can be existential â€” questioning our long-held beliefs.

This reminds me of a book that says when we talk to people or try to persuade them, we should be prepared for defensive comebacks because it might just make their whole world crumble.

It also resembles [[20221224153623|Risk and Fear]], where thinking twice is equivalent to thinking outside our comfort zone, our old thinking habits.
