# Thinking Mode

There are four types of thinking mode, a.k.a., four mindsets[^1]:

1. Preaching: promoting our ideas
2. Prosecuting: marshaling arguments to prove other people's ideas are wrong
3. Politicking: lobbying for votes from the audience
4. Researching: finding truth via running test experiments

It is a vicious cycle if we get stuck in the first three modes, our views will get reinforced with [[20230101110239|Overconfidence]], creating [[20230101111708|The Dictator Trap]].
