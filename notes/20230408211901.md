# The American Bias

Most research on Natural Language Processing targets English spoken in America; sometimes, it is so dominant that researchers don't bother to mention their target language anymore if it is English, even in international conferences. Fortunately, we have at least one popular rule — always mention the language you are working on — proposed by Emily Bender, a computational linguist from the University of Washington, to remind us of this bias.

But fighting this American-centric bias is more than about acknowledging the language: one article [[AI and the American Smile|AI and the American Smile]] demonstrates perfectly this encroaching impression of an American smile. It is hard to pinpoint the exact root issue with those generations, especially when every step could be infested with biases consciously or unconsciously:

1. Data collection bias: What is more accessible or more understandable to the collectors does not mean it is more popular or more of high quality to the whole planet[^1]. The Internet is not the world[^2].
2. Modeling bias: Modelling the data without proper vetting, filtering, or discernment is aiding whatever stereotype and toxicity exist within the data.
3. Evaluation bias:  Using some benchmarks in some languages that reflect some values often does not constitute a valid intelligence test[^3] [^4], which we don't even have a vigorous definition to begin with.
