# High-Order Polynomial Projection Operator

Core idea: if it is possible to learn a good representation of the history/context, then it should be easy to reconstruct the history/context.

Then the objective becomes:
1. To capture/encode/compress the history up to the current time step using hidden states;
2. To update such states efficiently when new information comes in;

To achieve that, you will need:
1. Approximation measure prior (e.g, recent over past)
2. HiPPO matrices ($A$ and $B$)

## HiPPO Operator

Borrowing from the idea of moving average, the HiPPO operator calculates the hidden state (approximation coefficients) based on the previous state $x(t)$ and input $u(t)$.

$$
x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)
$$
