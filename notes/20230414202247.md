![[The Status Trap#^875f85|The Status Trap]]

Chasing our dreams can be inspiring, but chasing status only gets us a one-way ticket into the rat race that never stops:
- It reinforces the idea that we are not good enough;
- It creates a false sense of security and belongingness;

Instead, we can quit the [[20230123142700|The Rat Race]] by:
- Facing the anxiety and learning to accept our insecurity;
- Writing;
- Finding meaningful goals;

This is a prime example of [[20221113145808|Goodhart's Law]] â€” the status becomes the target, but it is only one of many measurements for your success.
