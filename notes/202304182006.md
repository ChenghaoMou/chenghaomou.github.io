# Focus and Directions

We have finite will and attention each day, therefore we need to budget our energy right so that we can make progress in the right direction.

One goal at a time, or at least one primary goal at a time.[^1] With each additional direction we want to take at the same time, we can cover less distance. Too many options can often lead to paralysis, and too many habits can often lead to a jack-of-all-trades.
