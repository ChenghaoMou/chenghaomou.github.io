# Focus and Directions

We have finite willpower and attention each day. Therefore, we must budget our energy right to progress in the right direction.

One goal at a time, or at least one primary goal at a time.[^1] With each additional direction we want to take simultaneously, we lose our ability to produce quality work. Too many options can often lead to paralysis, and too many habits can often lead to a jack-of-all-trades.
