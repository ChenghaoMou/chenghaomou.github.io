# Making Friends as an Adult

Making friends sounds terrifying, but it will be much easier if you start by assuming people already like you, the meet-ups will go well, and you will not be rejected[^1]. 

Worrying about being rejected and therefore not making an effort towards building a friendship may be comfortable[^2] at first, but the loneliness will eventually get out of hand. In the end, you will find yourself in this downward spiral that you literally become someone that is less likely to be approachable.

Putting yourself out there has some risk, and you can never to ready[^3], but not taking a such risk will likely yield a far worse life in the long run[^4]. Making efforts also does not just mean showing up, it also needs you to be present, be engaged, and reciprocate.
