# Self-censorship

Self-censorship is an interesting instance of the prisoner's dilemma: If you are the only one who speaks the truth, you will be singled out as a traitor, even though everyone else is thinking the same. You also cannot join someone who speaks out because you fear you will be the only one to do so. In the end, everyone fears for his life, and no one actually acts[^1].
