# Contextuality

> You shall know a word by the company it keeps (Firth, J. R. 1957:11)

At this point, I wonder if the above famous quote is leading us awry. Yes, it ignited the idea of distributed representation and shaped the current natural language processing research community the way it is. But it feels lacking in terms of capturing the larger context the language lives in â€” the physical world the language users share, the personal experience, and preferences each language user has, and I am seeing nothing on the horizon that remotely tries to solve it. 

It is already problematic for low-resource languages in real-life applications[^1] [^2], yet we care more about SOTA results on some benchmarks instead of taking care of the problems at hand. Should we name whatever we are doing/the model is learning into something different? Maybe formal embeddings instead of contextual embeddings?
