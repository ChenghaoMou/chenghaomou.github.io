But it feels lacking in terms of capturing the larger context our languages live in â€” the physical world the language users share, the personal experience, and preferences each language user has. I am seeing nothing on the horizon that remotely tries to solve it.

It has been already problematic for low-resource languages in real-life applications[^1] [^2]. Yet, we care more about SOTA results on some benchmarks than addressing actual problems. Should we name whatever we are doing or whatever the model is learning something different? Maybe textual embeddings instead of contextual embeddings?
