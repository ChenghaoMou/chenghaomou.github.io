# Gifting with Experience

Instead of buying gifts for your friends, you can buy them for yourself and let your friends use them, such that they will not feel bad for taking something from you and all of you can enjoy something together[^1]. 

From a minimalist standpoint, oftentimes, purchases of physical possessions are more expensive[^2], both financially and mentally. Therefore, purchasing experience is much more suitable[^3] [^4]. Although, it is not necessarily always true, considering all factors[^5].

Then there is another issue about fulfilling unmaterial needs — love, joy, self-esteem — with material things: you can never quench the thirst for more[^6]. Non-material experience is one good way to satisfy them.
