# AI Adoption Bias

Inspiration: [[Will A.I. Become the New McKinsey-|Will A.I. Become the New McKinsey?]]

Companies can choose law firms, third-party vendors, experts, or consultants to give them the answers they want, to justify policies or decisions they intend to make, and to shift the blame. AI, unfortunately, can be used in a similar way. They can be deployed as a way to evade responsibilities no matter how impartial such algorithms or models have been portrayed in the media and how biased we are towards automation[^1].

No matter how environmental-friendly, ethically aware, or pro-social your model can become, there are always alternatives that better suit leadership's needs.  In the end, AI adoption ends up being a tool to build another moat for the people in power.
