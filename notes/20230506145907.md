# Writing is like Visiting a Country

Source: [[Writing is Like Entering a Huge Country- How I Found My Way]]

Writing doesn't have to be difficult. It is a process[^1], and a chance to learn something new[^1]. Like visiting a foreign country, you start off not knowing and you end up richer with the knowledge you did not have before[^2]. Such visits can help you build confidence in your writing, and nurture a positive feedback loop around writing[^3].
