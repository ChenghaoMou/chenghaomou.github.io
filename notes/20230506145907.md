# Writing is like Visiting a Country

Source: [[Writing is Like Entering a Huge Country- How I Found My Way]]

Writing doesn't have to be difficult. It is a process and a chance to learn something new[^1]. Like visiting a foreign country, you start off not knowing and end up richer with the knowledge you did not have before[^2]. Such visits can help you build confidence in your writing and nurture a positive feedback loop around writing[^3].

In the same vein, reading is similar too. There are people out there who share the same experiences or feelings and have the power to put them into context. There are desires to connect and form a relationship with the reader based on the mutual understanding of what it means to be a human being[^4].
