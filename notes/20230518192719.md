# Right to Repair

Reference: [[Companies are radically redefining what it means to 'own' something|Companies are radically redefining what it means to 'own' something]]

When buying something, especially products for long-term use, choose the ones or the brands that allow you to fix them with first-party or third-party parts. Being able to repair is a critical skill that not only saves you money but also helps cut waste. 

If it is something that you have to purchase and then subscribe to specific services to use, it is not a purchase at all. That's more like a down payment.
