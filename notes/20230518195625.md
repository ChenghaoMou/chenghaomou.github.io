# Error Bars

Reference: [[krzywinski_2013|Error bars]]

## Standard Deviation

The variation of the data, not the error in your measurement.

```
population = [...]
sample_stats = []
measurements = 10
sample_size = 10
for i in range(measurements):
	sample = random.sample(population, sample_size)
	sample_stats.append(np.mean(sample))

mean_ = np.mean(sample_stats)
std_ = np.std(sample_stats)
```

## Standard Error of the Mean

Uncertainty in the values. Not overlapping does not grant significance.

```
population = [...]
means = []
out_measurements = 10
for _ in range(out_measurements):
	sample_stats = []
	measurements = 10
	sample_size = 10
	for i in range(measurements):
		sample = random.sample(population, sample_size)
		sample_stats.append(np.mean(sample))
	means.append(np.mean(sample_stats))

mean_ = np.mean(means)
se = np.std(means) / math.sqrt(len(means))
```

## Confidence interval

The interval captures the population mean CI% of the time.

```
CI_95 = (mean_ - se * 1.96, mean_ + se * 1.96)
```
