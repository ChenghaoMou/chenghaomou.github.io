# LLM Maximalism

Reference: [[Against LLM maximalism|Against LLM maximalism]]

Using only LLMs for tasks â€” using LLMs to the maximum extent. For example, preprocessing and postprocessing data in the prompt instead of handling them in separate steps. 

At this point, the prompt or controllability of LLMs is unstable at best. People have been developing software based on modularity, flexibility, extensibility, and decoupling for decades, but all seem lost in the model-building world.

Ask not what AI/LLMs can do for us, ask what problems we have, then ask if AI/LLMs can help[^1].

One solution against LLM Maximalism:

1. Break down your question into steps, components, and layers;
2. Identify in what steps a model should be and can be engaged, and what steps deterministic programming is needed;
3. Identify meaningful metrics and evaluate what works and what doesn't;
4. Iteratively design and improve the pipeline(e.g, data labeling and model fine-tuning);
