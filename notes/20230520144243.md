# AI and Productivity

Reference: [[AI Is a Waste of Time|AI Is a Waste of Time]]

AI is a double-edged sword when it comes to our productivity: it will ease the friction when doing mundane tasks but also allow us to squander our free time watching addictive videos and scrolling our phones.

There will be companies trying to grab our attention and time with AI â€” quite ironically, they will be ones ripping the benefit of AI as a form of increased ad revenue, while consumers who couldn't bear the idea of being inactive or understimulated will suffer.

How can we fight back? It is already bad enough that people in power, and now equipped with AI, are aggregating more power[^1]. Which part of [[20230212204146|AI Democratization]] can help us? Is XXX (AI, NFT, crypto, web 3.0, web 2.0) another time-killing phase in human history?
