A distortion mirror that reflects anything, creating an illusion of reality without any accurate understanding of the world or the truth. It cannot interact without the world, let alone form actual knowledge.

The generalization of trained models might create something that does not exist in the training data, hence the "distortion" part. The novelty or creativity[^1] [^2] only makes sense by our perception, regardless of intention, usefulness or entertainingness.
