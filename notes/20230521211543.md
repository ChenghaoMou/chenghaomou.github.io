# Predictable and Preventable AI Bias

Source: [[Humans and algorithms work together - so study them together|Humans and algorithms work together - so study them together]]

If the [[20230521210832|AI Mirror]] metaphor holds, solving biases, inequalities, or stereotypes should primarily rely on how we, or experts, tackle them in the real world. It is almost certain that uncareful data curation and mindless scaling won't solve the problem as long as we keep scraping the open internet. As a result, exhibiting biases and stereotypes is something those large models cannot escape. But if this is how people choose to go, then such undesirability is undoubtedly predictable.

But are we close to solving those problems in our society? No perfect solution exists, so we should expect no scalable solution from AI models. Sometimes I wonder if we are asking the right question or not. Also, is bias the right word? To me, it is ascribing too much agency to the model when we say it is biased.
