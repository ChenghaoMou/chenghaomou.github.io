# Manifesting Magic

Source: [[Becoming a magician|Becoming a magician]]

Image a version of yourself that feels impossible and unattainable right now.

This sets a beacon in our uncharted life journey. We don't know how and when, but we subconsciously know what it looks like. It is almost like goal setting, but much more outlandish and long-term than most goals. That's why when we look back at it, it feels like magic.

To help establish such self-image, you can ask yourself the following questions:
1. What is the most capable version of me that I can imagine? Role models can help you with this, so surround yourself with magicians you want to follow.
2. What would I be doing if all my current major problems had been solved?
3. What are the things I say I value but I haven't acted; what would my life be if I actually did?
4. What am I afraid of doing; what would my life be if I am not?

On the other hand, [[20220604131222|Premeditatio Malorum]] imagines the worst possible to overcome inactivity.
