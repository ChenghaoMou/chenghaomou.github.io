# Bias as Unjustified Direct Causal Effect

Reference: [[The bias puzzle - Understanding gender differences in academia|The bias puzzle - Understanding gender differences in academia]]

When we talk about bias, we often talk about the end results being perceived as biased, e.g. men get more grants than women in the same university, even though with the same qualifications. However, the leading factors in the direct decision-making process, grant evaluation in this case, might actually be completely free of bias, and only when you look deeper into such inequality, do you discover the root cause â€” the gender bias in the hiring process indirectly impact the funding women receive.

Such indirect bias can be referred to as disparity with respect to the observations, instead of bias, which is direct and unjustified in nature. If the focus or reference is on the hiring process, only then it becomes a bias.
