# p-Value and Statistical Significance

## Hypothesis Testing

- Null Hypothesis: the effect does not exist â€” two samples are from the same distribution, e.g.
- Alternative Hypothesis: the effect does exist.

## p-Value

Given the null hypothesis is true, the p-value tells you how likely you'd see the data you observed. By choosing a threshold beforehand, you can decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.

But this does not mean any **decisions** based solely on p-values are correct. When reporting, p-values should come with proper context and other evidence, and preferably with other approaches that are more suitable and feasible for your data[^1].

The confusion matrix of hypothesis testing:

- $\alpha$: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true;
- $\beta$: Accepting the null hypothesis when it is false;

| Decision\Actual                 | $H_0$ is true                                    | $H_0$ is false                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Accept $H_0$ (Failed to reject) | Correct decision<br>Confidence<br>$(1 - \alpha)$ | False Negative<br>Type II Error<br>$\beta$ |
| Reject $H_0$                    | False Positive<br>Type I Error<br>$\alpha$       | Correct decision<br>Power<br>$1-\beta$     |

Steps:

1. Form the hypothesis (null and alternative);
2. Choose the significance level $\alpha$;
3. Collect the data and calculate the p-value $p$: $p \le \alpha$, reject $H_0$ or fail to reject $H_0$ otherwise;
4. Make a decision and draw conclusions.
