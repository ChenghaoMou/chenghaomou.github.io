# p-Value and Statistical Significance

## Hypothesis Testing

Null Hypothesis: the effect does not exist â€” two samples are from the same distribution, e.g.
Alternative Hypothesis: the effect does exist.

## p-Value

Given the null hypothesis is true, the p-value tells you how likely you'd see the data you observed. By choosing a threshold beforehand, you can decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.

But this does not mean any **decisions** based solely on p-values are correct. When reporting, p-values should come with proper context and other evidence, and preferably with other approaches that are more suitable and feasible for your data[^1].
