Finding a needle in the haystack has always been the go-to metaphor in this Internet era, but it never occurs to me that it could be "haystack-sized piles of needles"[^1].

No amount of prioritization or elimination will quench the neverending encounter with new or relevant information ([[The Never-Ending Now|The Never-Ending Now]]).
