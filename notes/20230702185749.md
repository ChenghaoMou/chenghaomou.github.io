# Is Programming Here to Stay?

Can a system generate detailed programs that completely satisfy a client who only gives vague and high-level requirements/abstractions? Where does it find all the specifications required for the intricacy that enables the program to function in the real world with real users, if not from the client?

If the client has to provide such detail, then what the client does is no different from programming/coding â€” "well-specified requirements are as formal as code"[^1].

But what if the decisions were delegated to the system on the client's behalf, where the system draws decisions from a large amount of data? Would this be considered a counter-example to the claim?
