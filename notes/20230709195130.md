# Something Bad VS Nothing

Source: [[AI Could Change How Blind People See the World|AI Could Change How Blind People See the World]]

We know AI models generate ungrounded output that is often riddled with mistakes, but for people that have no access to any form of information at all otherwise, it might help in a much more convenient way.

For people arguing that it could provide medical advice to people who don't have access to a doctor, I would say access to the Internet and a salary that can afford to pay the API usage makes more sense. If building the Internet infrastructure isn't an issue, why not build a clinic or a hospital while you are at it? This is a case where having something bad means that you could have something good.
