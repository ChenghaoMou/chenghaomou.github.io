# Looking Stupid

Source: [[Willingness to look stupid|Willingness to look stupid]]

Asking stupid questions does not necessarily mean that you are stupid. It could mean you are brave enough to challenge the unspoken and widely accepted answer, and sometimes you are right. This is a great opportunity to learn, a small one nonetheless. But a habit of asking questions, even though it might make you look stupid to other people, has the compounding benefit of understanding things deeper.

Sometimes, a stupid or obvious question might lead to offbeat and easy paths. And entertaining a stupid question intellectually is equally important.

To avoid looking stupid is like a survival instinct, and it might lead to being passed on from opportunities (e.g. interviews). Interestingly and ironically, we have [[20220704155657|Dunning-Kruger Effect and Imposter Syndrome]] and are simultaneously afraid of looking stupid.
