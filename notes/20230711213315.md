# Neoliberalism and AI Solutionism

Source: [[The True Threat of Artificial Intelligence|The True Threat of Artificial Intelligence]]

[Neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism) is often associated with privatisation and deregularisation, and the recent A.G.I-ism has echoed some of its main biases:

1. Market bias: market privatisation and decreased government functions in society. In this case, private and closed-source models vs open-source models;
2. Adaptation bias: adaptation to private sectors solutions instead of imagining a better alternative;
3. Efficiency bias: efficiency over social concerns/benefits — asking the users to debug their bugs for free; Everything is a technical issue and requires a for-profit technological solution.

The problem with solutionism is that they never bother to ask a deeper level of why (transformative) and settle on solving superficial problems (adaptive). For example, it will ask people to walk more but never tries to improve the city's public infrastructure for walking. The latter requires a lot more than making an app, admittedly. But it does not mean we should not bother to ask, and we should resist solutionism by rooting our goals in reality — a reality with rich social and cultural resources that aren't just mere training data.
