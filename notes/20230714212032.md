# Learning the Skeptical Way

Being skeptical can make you look defensive or aggressive when approaching other people's claims. But it also makes the learning journey heartfelt when we are also being **open-minded**. It will feel like a mini you-vs-the-author debate or a friendly martial combat: Adversarial attacks makes the claim clearer.

It might make things artificially difficult and sometimes cynical, but it is exactly the point. However, unilaterally being critical of everything could work against you if you let it[^1]. The important part is understanding the motivation behind the stance â€” is it to learn or is it to win?
