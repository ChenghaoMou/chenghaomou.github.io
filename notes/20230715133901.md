Mission science refers to science around a shared normative stance. Mission scientists approach research questions with the goal to help. They are motived by the why question that stems from core pragmatic concerns, instead of being swayed by corporal or political agendas.

But it also comes with a price: Once your study becomes relevant and unfortunately goes against powers at play, it makes you a target of smear campaigns.

How do you tell the difference between a scientific study and a "scientific" propaganda? We know science is supposed to be free of political influence, but we can't expect all scientists to be free of political preferences.
