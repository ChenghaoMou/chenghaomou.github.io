# Glue Work Theory

Here is my hypothesis: The more capable you are of working in a company, the more glue work you have to do, and the less room you will have for your professional growth.

Your work is vital to the company but no longer to you. The knowledge you will gain from glue work is about the company, the platform, or the system, but it could no longer resonate with you. Compared with newcomers, who have fewer clues on what is happening and get projects that suit their skills/interests the best, tenured workers' work becomes managerial and orchestral, even if they didn't want to go down that path.

Some people like me are happy solving problems within their domain or interest. Why can't they leave us alone? Why is the corporate ladder always leading to leadership?
