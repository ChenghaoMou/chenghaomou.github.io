A license should defaults to saying no to something that is newly developed in the present that hasn't been included in the past when the contract/license was signed. Opt-in should be the assumed option, especially regarding to user data and user information[^1].

Things change, and we could never imagine what it is like in three years, let alone a decade. When platforms or companies acquire some licences, it should never be all-encompassing and future-proof. It should be assumed under the **current circumstances** *in the days to come*. Drastic technological changes do happen, and when it comes, right owners should have a chance to discuss what should be updated. This is the least amount of respect we should pay for human labour and human creativity.

Anonymisation may have worked effectively 10 years ago, but now de-identification is more efficient due to powerful statistical models and big data. Should we withdraw our consent with the emergence of such technology? If not, it is reasonable to believe that everyone who consented to share anonymised information will be essentially exposed on the Internet in 10 years.

Even beyond formal agreements, we have to fight constantly with small consent traps such as marketing emails, mailing lists, TOS updates buried with legalese and sometimes outright spams[^2]. If users can't make informed decisions about their data [[20230107143218|Informed Consent]], then an opt-out makes no sense[^3].

*But changes in the society are difficult and vague to measure. How to corporate such condition into a formal licence agreement?*
