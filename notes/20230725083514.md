# A Default No to Something New

Inspiration: [[Justine Bateman on AI, Labor, and the Future of Entertainment|Justine Bateman on AI, Labor, and the Future of Entertainment]]

A license should defaults to saying no to something that is newly developed in the present that hasn't been included in the past.

Things change, and we could never imagine what it is like in three years, let alone a decade. When platforms or companies acquire some licenses, it should never be all-emcompassingly future-proof. It should be assumed under the **current circumstances** *in the future*. Drastic technological changes do happen, and when it comes, right-owners should have a chance to discuss what should be updated. This is the least amount of respect we should pay for human labor and human creativity.

Like anonymization worked maybe 10 years ago, but now de-identification works more efficiently enabled by powerful statistical models and big data, should our consent be withdrawl with such emergence of technology? If not, it is reasonable to believe that everyone who consented sharing anonymized information now will be pretty much surfing the Internet naked in 10 years.

*But changes in the society are difficult and vague to measure. How to corporate such condition into a formal license agreement?*
