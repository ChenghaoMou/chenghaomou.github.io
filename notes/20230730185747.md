# Oil Spill in Our Information Ecosystem

A metaphor mentioned in [[“Ensuring Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI”- What those seven companies avoided committing to]], which actually is very similar in spirit to the dark forest metaphor[^1].

The oil spill not only impacts the people who receive the information but also pollutes the ecosystem as a whole, making trust increasingly harder to find and give.
