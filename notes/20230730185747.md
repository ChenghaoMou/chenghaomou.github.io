# Oil Spill in Our Information Ecosystem

A metaphor mentioned in [[“Ensuring Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI”- What those seven companies avoided committing to]], which actually is very similar in spirit to the dark forest metaphor used in [[The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI|The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI]].

The oil spill — the spread of misinformation or unreliable generation at a much larger scale thanks to popularised Generative AI — impacts the people who receive the information (e.g. [[36129681|The I in LLM Stands for Intelligence]], [[A Concerning Trend]]) and pollutes the ecosystem as a whole, making trust and authenticity increasingly harder to find and give.

Moreover, the problem is compounded when such spills get picked up as the training data for the next iteration. Case in point: [[34910990|Multifaceted: The Linguistic Echo Chambers of LLMs]]
