# Transference and Anthropomorphization

In psychotherapy, transference refers to people projecting their past feelings onto someone in the present. A great metaphor from [[‘A certain danger lurks there’- how the inventor of the first chatbot turned against AI]]:

>When we interact with other people, we always bring a group of ghosts to the encounter. The residue of our earlier life, and above all our childhood, is the screen through which we see one another.

Transference and [[20230305142934|Anthropomorphization]] make a potent combination when interacting with a chatbot. People project their past experience interacting with human beings in similar interfaces onto the current one and attribute human characteristics and abilities to the chatbot. This is also called the "Eliza effect"[^1].
