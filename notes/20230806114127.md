# Hijacked Transference

We already know how AI models take advantage of our tendency to anthropomorphise[^1] [^2], but now we also witness companies and people, unknowingly or not, taking advantage of words or phrases that we used to have a clear understanding:
1. Calling their release of a model as open-sourcing while imposing usage restrictions[^3];
2. Calling unreliable model synthesis a hallucination;
3. Calling capitalisation as [[20230212204146|Democratization]];

Admittedly, language is supposed to change and adapt to our reality. Still, we should be careful when such a phenomenon emerges and pause to ask whether this change is warranted.
