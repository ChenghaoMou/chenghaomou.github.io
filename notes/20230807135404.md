# Language Fluency Fallacy

Source: [[Language Is a Poor Heuristic for Intelligence|Language Is a Poor Heuristic for Intelligence]]

Equating language fluency with intelligence and inarticulacy with unintelligence.

Oftentimes, people assume others are unintelligent because they can't speak or speak fluently. This is a completely false narrative â€” e.g., kids with autistic or hearing disabilities have fully 'normal' intelligence by any type of measurement people normally conduct.

But this fallacy has been [[20230806114127|transferred]] to our interactions with LLM-based chatbots, even though from the opposite perspective. With another fallacy that computer-generated information is accurate and unbiased, this creates a discrepancy where AI bros are eager to fill with hype and promises while reaping the profits[^1].
