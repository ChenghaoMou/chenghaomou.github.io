# Language Fluency Fallacy

Source: [[Language Is a Poor Heuristic for Intelligence|Language Is a Poor Heuristic for Intelligence]]

A fallacy equating language fluency with intelligence. It has been shown that in our brain, networks that in charge of language are largely separated from logical thinking networks[^1].

Oftentimes, people assume others are unintelligent because they can't speak or speak fluently. This is an incorrect narrative â€” e.g., kids with autistic or hearing disabilities have fully 'normal' intelligence by any type of measurement.

But this fallacy has been [[20230806114127|transferred]] to our interactions with LLM-based chatbots, even though from the opposite perspective. To make it worse, we often have another fallacy that computer-generated information is more accurate and unbiased. This creates a gap where AI bros are eager to fill with hype and promises while reaping the profits[^2].
