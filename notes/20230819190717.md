## Goals

In a corporate setting, programmers are workers who drive revenue and cost with programming, hopefully not in the same direction. They usually aren't incentivised to produce elegant software from a company level. Individuals might aspire to do so, but this is hardly a work thing any more. Work to live, don't live to work.

## Friends

You may find a few good friends, but trying to make everyone your friend is a waste of time. With that being said, being kind to people is always a no-brainer.

## Communication

It is important. You are selling something to someone, internally or externally.

## Reading

Read something about negotiation. This helps for your career even though it sounds cringe. There are people who are better at negotiation, just like how you are better at programming. And imagine that with money on the line.
