# DORA Metrics

Source: [[Yes, you can measure software developer productivity|Yes, you can measure software developer productivity]]

A set of developer productivity metrics from Google's DevOps research and assessment team:

- Deployment frequency: how often is the code being successfully deployed;
- Lead time for changes: time needed from code being committed to production;
- Time to restore service: how long it takes to restore service if there is an outage or a bug;
- Change failure rate: what percentage of changes that are committed lead to service degradation;
