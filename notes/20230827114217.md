# Stolen Attention

Inspiration: [[31596656|Attention didn’t collapse. It was stolen (2022)]]

Our attention span is shrinking, and it is a societal and technological result that individuals rarely can resist: modern technology creates an illusion that we are good at multitasking[^1] and that our productivity is improved, but it is quite the opposite[^2]. And every social network company is trying to get us hooked with unlimited feeds and interactions[^3] [^4] [^5].

Like any other societal issue, fighting alone or individual abstinence is not enough. It does not address the root cause that requires a seismic shift in every fabric of society: regulation, education, and more.
