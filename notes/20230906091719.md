1. Focus more on building your career instead of your investment;
2. No one can predict the future, and a perfect track record should not warrant any more trust;
3. No one else can treat your money with the same respect you do;
4. Don't invest on a whim. When in doubt, go safe;
5. Every investment waxes and wanes;
6. Diversify and be aware of geopolitical vulnerabilities;
7. Keep a safety net;
8. To bet as if you can afford the loss;
