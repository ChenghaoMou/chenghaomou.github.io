Inspiration: [[31926543|Scholarship Should Be Open]]

Slow productivity in research.

People using preprint services as a way of flag planting create a hostile "if-not-latest-then-irrelevant" research environment. People who cite preprint versions of a paper, instead of the peer-reviewed one when possible are subsequently biding such behaviour.
