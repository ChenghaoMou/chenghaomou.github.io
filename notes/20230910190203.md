# Minimalism and the Good Design Principles

> Indifference towards people and the reality in which they live is actually the one and only cardinal sin in design.
>
> â€” <i>Dieter Rams</i>

Dieter Rams proposed the [Good Design Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams#%22Good_design%22_principles), according to which good design should:

1. be long-lasting;
2. be innovative;
3. be eco-friendly;
4. be esthetic;
5. be honest;
6. be unobtrusive;
7. be thorough down to the last detail;
8. be as little design as possible;
9. make the product useful;
10. make the product understandable;

Sometimes, you see designs that might have taken those principles too literally: compounding 10 finger dances into two buttons to maximize #8, yet completely disregard #9[^1]. Little design does not mean stripping away most of the functionalities, just like minimalism does not mean frugal or stoic living. There might be some overlap, but that's not what there is about each practice;

Some of them look perfect on paper, but when a company succumbs to the market pressure to churn out generations of products with shorter and shorter life-span, being eco-friendly and long-lasting becomes a luxury that few people can afford;
