# Engineer Productivity

If all you can measure is around the artifacts (code, features, bugs, time, satisfaction, etc.)[^1] [^2] [^3], you can't really gauge some aspects of an engineer's work, such as contribution to the team culture, personal growth, or collaboration environment; Such glue work and liaison can rarely be reflected in the rigid evaluation metrics[^4];
