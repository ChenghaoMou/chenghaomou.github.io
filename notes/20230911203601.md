A good sleep habit is also a good learning habit and a good well-being habit. Unfortunately, it is vulnerable to any disruptions so consistency is the key to leveraging this passive time into an active personal growth session.

1. Reduce caffeine and [[20230911204127|alcohol]] intake;
2. Remove screens (blue lights) from your bedroom and therefore alertness from your system;
3. Have a cool bedroom to facilitate your falling asleep;
4. Have a regular bedtime and wake-up time;
5. Only go to bed when you are sleepy, avoiding irrelevant associations with your bed;
6. Avoid daytime naps to maintain a high sleep drive;
7. Reduce active thoughts before bed, by journaling or meditation;
8. There is no need for a clock in the bedroom;
