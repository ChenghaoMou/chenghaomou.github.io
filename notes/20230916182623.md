EFT can manifest as many things in different settings. In the workplace, many administrative processes are added to deter employees from filing reimbursement or claiming benefits. In a relationship, housework and chores — the ones usually undertaken by the female partner — leave no room for the wife's personal growth.

Unlike what is described in [[31554997|Deep Work]], we may not have a choice to say no to shallow work due to EFT. This form of mental exploitation, invisible and emotional labour, an interesting complementary perspective to [[20230723121610|Glue Work Theory]], makes it impossible to allow deep work in the first place, no matter how much we desire it internally.
