# Short-form Reading is No Reading At All

You can't read a book by its summary, or worse, its cover. It is like noting the existence of a book by touching it with a feather in one of your meditation sessions. You may have a good guess on what it is about, but you never truly understand the depth of authors' arguments, nor the evidence they present.
