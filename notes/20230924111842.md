# LLMs Fail at Simple Commonsense Reasoning

It shows a failure mode that even the state-of-the-art models can't escape: when "knowing" $A \rightarrow B$, it can't reliably predict the reverse relation, namely $B \rightarrow A$[^1].

This highlights the gap between the AI hype and reality. People are more willing to accept or even advertise a model's success while completely ignorant or even intentionally blind to obvious problems that have surfaced[^2].
