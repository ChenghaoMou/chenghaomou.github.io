# When We Talk about Open Source

One thing is clear: We are not prescribing it as a panacea when discussing models or datasets, especially in the Generative AI era. It does not automatically guarantee the code or conduct related to the artefacts shared is any more secure or ethical.

Open source means a chance to pry open the black box, examine, criticise, and enhance. As a result, it speeds up progress for the community by allowing individuals to create incremental research, ensuring that this foundation is more durable than certain APIs controlled by centralised entities[^1].

Even without the actual release, by simply setting out to be open-source, you are priming yourself or the project for a higher standard[^1].
