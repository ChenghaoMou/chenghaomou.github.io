# The Innovator’s Dilemma

A company may halt or slow down its innovation to not disrupt its existing product or market, which has been proven successful in the past.

One prime example is Google Search, with the recent launch of Bard. "Google thus has little incentive to move us beyond traditional search, at least not in a paradigm-shifting way, until it figures out how to make the money aspect work. In the meantime, it’ll stick with the less impressive Google Assistant."[^1]

Another example is research. Scientists withhold their study details as much as possible — just enough to pass the peer review — to pave the way for future research with little to no competition[^2].
