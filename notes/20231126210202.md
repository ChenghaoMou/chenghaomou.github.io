# Why Do We Complain?

When we complain, we feel good momentarily because it feels like we are being more critical and smarter[^1] [^4].

However, it is a sign of low self-esteem when we masquerade with constant complaints to feel good about ourselves[^1]. It also masks out the hopelessness we feel from caring about issues but not contributing to solving them[^4].

Being cynical or hostile to the outside world makes us feel safe, but it will become difficult to imagine a better future if we can't positively talk about it[^2] [^3].

Complaining or anger won't solve the problem, neither is avoidance nor obsession. This is why we need to **validate** our emotions — acknowledging its existence and moving on[^4].
