# Why Do We Complain?

When we complain, we feel good momentarily because it feels like we are being more critical and smarter.

However, it is a sign of low self-esteem when we masquerade with constant complaints to feel good about ourselves[^1].

Being cynical or hostile to the outside world makes us feel safe, but it will become difficult to imagine a better future if we can't positively talk about it[^2] [^3].
