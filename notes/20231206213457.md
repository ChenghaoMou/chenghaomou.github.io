# Reading with Cognitive Models

Books or lectures are passive mediums, meaning they don't actively distil the knowledge directly into your mind. They don't have an active cognitive model that encourages you to understand, reflect, or apply what you have been reading or listening to. That's why plain reading or simply taking quotes in a notebook cannot magically make you remember anything. You have to make an intentional effort to understand the content by paraphrasing, summarization, or active recalling[^1].

This is very similar to what is mentioned in [[31554993|How to Take Smart Notes]] where notes are supposed to be in your own words[^2] [^3].
