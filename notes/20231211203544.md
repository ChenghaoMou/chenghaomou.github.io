# Addictive Atomic Habits

Reference: [[35283632|Smartphone and Internet Addiction: The Definitive WIRED Guide]]

There are psychological factors behind those recommendation systems. Social media companies use the same trick  — triggers or cues (notifications), motivation (FOMO), and ease of access (mobile apps) — as what we use in fostering atomic habits.

They also leverage our negative emotions, such as boredom, loneliness, and frustration, to lure us into mindless consumption that temporarily takes our minds off those negative emotions.

It's a potent combination, indeed. The same can also be used for education: Duolingo is a perfect example.
