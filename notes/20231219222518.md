# Techno-selectionism

Accepting that technology can improve our lives while believing we should have our chance to say no or choose an alternative without such technology[^1].

A middle ground between techno-optimism and techno-skepticism. This echoes the power-over-technology spirit in [[20230307200456|A New Definition of Luddism]] and the sprouting open-source projects for [[20230212204146|AI Democratization]].
