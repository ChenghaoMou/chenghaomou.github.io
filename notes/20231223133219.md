Model performance and size have steadily increased over the past decade, as have the complexity and cost of understanding such models and datasets.

This is why open source is important — it allows us to fix issues within[^1], and why research should be transparent, inclusive and slow[^2]. On the other hand, open sourcing the data or model might give competitors or regulators leverage to be taken advantage of — a suitation where most laywers would advice you not to do so.
