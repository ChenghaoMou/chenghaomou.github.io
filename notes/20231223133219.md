Model performance and size have steadily increased over the past decade, so have the complexity and cost of understanding such models and datasets.

This is why open source is important — it allows us to fix issues within[^1], and why research should be transparent, inclusive and slow[^2].

On the other hand, open sourcing the data or model might give competitors — especially the closed ones — som advantage. However, companies like Meta argue that such advantage will be constantly marginalised due to the development pace and thriving developer ecosystem[^3].
