# On What Preparedness Failed to Prepare for

Source: [[35649908|Preparedness]]

It did not prepare us for the fact that this is simply a techno-solutionism x techno-optimism narrative, nothing more than an opinion piece.

It assumed that their models are inevitable and people should be prepared for what comes next after the models have been made. No questions shall be asked about why we need them in the first place, how they are being made, and what harm it has done during the process.

All is good as soon as the model is made because they have their best teams to mitigate the risks from those models, and they shall deliver. But they will not mitigate risks from the decisions to make the models or datasets in the first place, and certainly not from the motivations behind those decisions, as long as they still want to be employed.

Models are shoved into our faces, and we are treated like guineanea pigs for their research and "continue learning" without compensation or acknowledgement. We deserve better.
