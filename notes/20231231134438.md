# Pre-filling and Chunking

![[jiang_2023#^411f1d|Mistral 7B]]

If the prompt is already known before generation, then it is more efficient to pre-calculate the weights if [[20231231132200|Sliding Window Attention]] is used.

There is no need to calculate the entire attention matrix as well. One can chunk them into smaller blocks (usually by the window size) for faster and efficient calculation.
