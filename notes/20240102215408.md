# What Does It Mean to Have Human-level Intelligence

Some argue that it is acceptable for models to "hallucinate"[^1] because humans make mistakes too.

The sampling/generation process is, as of today, not grounded in truth or fact-checked in any meaningful way, completely different from how humans make a mistake, intentionally or unintentionally. People do lie, fabricate, or cheat, that's because we often have motivations and intentions to do so[^2].

Moreover, it is crucial to consider the broader context: these models do not operate on the same scale as any human in any other axis. Despite this, they have been credited with unwarranted influence, agency, and audience yet afford no responsibility for any consequences.

Though many AI companies boast about human-level intelligence, showcasing their ambition and commitment, few have clearly defined what it means. The ambiguity seems intentional as they can move the goalposts whenever they see fit, and the public, while can't hold them accountable, still inevitably becomes their guinea pigs for their development.
