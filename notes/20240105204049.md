# Techno-Feudalism

A variation of [[20231224131140|Feudal Security]] by taking rents for the use of the resource/technology instead of profits from innovation, a.k.a subscription slavery, coined by Yanis Varoufakis[^1] [^2]. A key difference between feudalism and capitalism is that feudalism extracts rents, through modern fiefdom like cloud or platform.

Three groups of people who are affected by technofeudalism:
1. Vassal capitalists: cloud platforms like Alibaba or Amazon;
2. Cloud proles: people like warehouse workers;
3. Cloud serfs: users that contribute to the company's *capital stock* in the form of content or labor while using its product;
