# Human Feedback Format
A taxonomy from [[fernandes_2023|Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation]]

![[fernandes_2023#^005c23]]

## Numerical
Typically, it is a score for a set of input and output. For example, a star system for a translation model:

```
Input: This is an English sentence.
Output: 这是一句英语句子。
---
Score: 5
```

It can be easy to collect, but it is subjective and difficult to differentiate between ties. But in a similar fashion, one can extend this rating to multiple aspects, such as accuracy and fluency in this case.
## Ranking
This moves beyond simple rating by ordering a set of output/responses. It is very useful in both evaluation and fine-tuning.
```
Input: This is a very long story about a new fancy summarisation model. It was developed by a company called Magic Summarisation, located on a distant planet called Magic Planet.

Output 1:  A new summarization model developed by Magic Summarisation ...
Output 2: Magic Summarisation has developed a new model ...
Output 3: Magic Summarisation, from Magic Planet, has released a new summarisation model ...

---
Ranking: 3 > 2 > 1
```

## Natural Language
It offers more nuance to scores and ranking because humans can add details to the feedback.

```
Input: This is a very long story about a new fancy summarisation model. It was developed by a company called Magic Summarisation, located on a distant planet called Magic Planet.

Output: A new summarization model ...
---
Missing the company info.
```

Such feedback can also take on a more restricted or formatted style, such as post-edition:

```
Input: This is a very long story about a new fancy summarisation model. It was developed by a company called Magic Summarisation, located on a distant planet called Magic Planet.

Output: A new summarization model ...
---
model -> model developed by Magic Summarisation
```

Or **Multidimensional Quality Metrics**:

```
Input: This is a very long story about a new fancy summarisation model. It was developed by a company called Magic Summarisation, located on a distant planet called Magic Planet.

Output: A new summarization model ...
---
model -> minor/completeness
```
