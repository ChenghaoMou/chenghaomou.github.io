# AI Plagiarism

Plagiarism occurs when the model regurgitates the data without permission or attribution.

Such plagiarism can take place with text data, such as [[lee_2022|Do Language Models Plagiarize?]], visual data, as in [[36377954|Generative AI Has a Visual Plagiarism Problem]] and potentially more.

There are a couple of ongoing lawsuits against those Gen AI companies on the grounds of copyright violation this year. We will have to see how it unfolds.
