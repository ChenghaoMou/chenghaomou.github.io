# AI Plagiarism

Plagiarism occurs when the model regurgitates the data without permission or attribution.

Such plagiarism can occur with text data, such as [[lee_2022|Do Language Models Plagiarize?]], visual data, as in [[36377954|Generative AI Has a Visual Plagiarism Problem]] and potentially more.

There are a couple of ongoing lawsuits against those Gen AI companies on the grounds of copyright violation this year. We will have to see how it unfolds[^1] [^2] [^3]. Companies like OpenAI are also trying to negotiate data licenses from publishers even when they publicly "admitted" that building on free public data was the only option[^4].
