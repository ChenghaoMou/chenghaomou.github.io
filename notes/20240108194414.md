# AI Plagiarism

Plagiarism occurs when the model regurgitates the data without permission or attribution.

Such plagiarism can occur with text data, such as [[lee_2022|Do Language Models Plagiarize?]], visual data, as in [[36377954|Generative AI Has a Visual Plagiarism Problem]] and potentially more.

There are a couple of ongoing lawsuits against those Gen AI companies on the grounds of copyright violation this year[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4]. We will have to see how it unfolds. Companies like OpenAI are also trying to negotiate data licenses from publishers even when they publicly "admitted" that building on free public data was the only option[^5]. Others are reported to knowingly scrape data and violate ToS or robots.txt conventions[^6] [^7].
