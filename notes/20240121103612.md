# Captured Customers and Habits under Capitalism

To create a habit-forming service that profits from a captured customer base[^1].

Customers often do not have an alternative to a service because of anti-competition or anti-interoperability. Such a service follows the [[20240105204049|Techno-Feudalism]] ideology for its rent-seeking behaviours by making using a service and, therefore, paying the subscription a normalised habit[^2].

Sadly, we no longer possess what we have purchased, a long overdue realisation after decades of skipping reading the TOS.
