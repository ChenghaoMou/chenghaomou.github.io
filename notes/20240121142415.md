# Cargo Cult Science

A pseudoscience research method that aims to confirm a pre-conceived hypothesis instead of vigorously disproving possible alternative explanations[^1].

This lack of self-criticism is a form of dishonesty by not striving to eliminate possible confounding factors. Some people argue that it is often belittled when compared to plagiarism[^2]. Maybe done unintentionally, it is less of a character flaw and more of a lack of scientific skill.
