# Co-Innovation

Co-innovation describes the virtuous cycle where a product's creator iterates the design with user feedback. The important factor of this loop is that users have given their consent and are aware of such data collection[^1].

However, oftentimes, such information is collected without consent, under vague contractual terms, or behind UI dark patterns, and it gradually becomes behavioural surveillance so that the company can assert more control over how users should use the product[^1].
