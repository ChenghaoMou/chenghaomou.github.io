# A Unified Theory of Fucks

Source: [[37153826|A Unified Theory of Fucks]]

A person has limited number of fucks to give. As one grows older, his fucks will eventually run out.

Somehow, it reminds me of this article – [[How Our Brains Are - and Aren’t - Like Computers|How Our Brains Are - and Aren’t - Like Computers]] where our brain prunes neural connections as we age. Maybe the loss of those connections also means losing the mental faculty to give a fuck.

Nevertheless, it still comes down to how we prioritise the limited fucks we can give. To our family, to our friends, and to ourselves, but definitely not work.
