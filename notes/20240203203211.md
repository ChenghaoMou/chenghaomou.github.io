# Being Fauxductive

Source: [[37275927|Fighting Infomania: Why 80% of Your Reading Is a Waste of Time]]

When you're doing something that "feels" productive but never meaningfully impact your life in any way, you're being fauxductive.

Examples abound: Doing house chores, organising your desk, checking the news, trying out the latest and hottest productive tool or watching a Youtube video on how to be productive. Those activities do not answer any specific need or question you might have, instead they just fill the void or the boredom so that you *feel* busy and productive.

A less obvious case would be reading. The majority of the information is either duplicate or irrelevant. Constant reading without introspection or putting the knowledge into practice is another way of being fauxductive[^1] [^2].

This has been echoed in many other ideas as well: [[20220709195323|Only Writing Counts]] when it comes to note-taking systems â€” it is the most mentally daunting step that challenges our understanding of something so we could put them on paper.
