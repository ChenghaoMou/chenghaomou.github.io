# Being Fauxductive

Source: [[37275927|Fighting Infomania: Why 80% of Your Reading Is a Waste of Time]]

When you're doing something that "feels" productive but never meaningfully impact your life in any way, you're being fauxductive.

Examples abound: Doing house chores, organising your desk, checking the news, trying out the latest and hotest productive tool or watching a Youtube video on how to be productive. Those activities do not answer any specific need or question you might have, instead they just fill the void or the boredom so that you feel busy and productive.

A less obvious case would be reading. The majority of the information is either duplicate or irrelevant. This has been echoed in many other ideas as well: The CODE method (Capture, Organise, Distil, and Express) stresses that we should capture only the ones that resonate with us. But, unfortunately, it is very unlikely we can trim down the noise just by being selective in this era of [[20230624141234|Information Overload]].
