## Data Collection

*This is a section about what information is being collected.*

In addition to legitimate data for business functional purposes (GPS coordinates for navigation), watch out for data that seem irrelevant such as device type and GPU usage, which might be utilised to create a unique fingerprint for you.

Take their description with a grain of salt, though. Phrases like "for example", "may", or "such as" distract you from their real and often more intrusive operations.
## Data Sharing

*What data is being shared and who they are sharing it with.*

Look out for service providers and patterns. They might use different privacy policies that you are also subject to.

## Data Use

*How data is being used.*

When words like "personalize" or "enhance" are mentioned regarding your experience with the product, it often means you are targeted for advertisement profiling.

## Data Management

*How data is stored, processed, and protected, and what your rights are under certain laws.

For example, under CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), you can expect companies to diclose any data collection in the past 12 months.
