# Cult AI

> Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.
It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system-ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.
> — *US President Dwight Eisenhower, 1961*

Handing over one's own agency and decision-making to an AI model — a perfect example of voluntary self-surrender in cult dynamics[^1]. The promising land of AGI, championed by Sillcon Valley elites, is based on faith rather than facts[^1] — that those AI models today are still [[20230115161911|Bullshit]] generators, with plagiarised content and misinformation[^1].

Leaders of the cult, authoritarian technocrats, foist their hypocritical beliefs onto the society, which is neither consulted nor effectively informed[^2]. The path leading to the so-called AGI has never been about the general good or the benefits for the humanity. Instead, it is all about profiting at scale fast.

Any attempt to regulate the technical development has been equated to a murder by those of effective accerlerationism (e/acc for short). It sounds culty beacuse it is. It serves to absolve those elites of any moral and ethical duty[^2], which is another perfect example of [[20240205144638|Negative Externalities]].

Luckily, we can fight back by saying no: [[20231219222518|Techno-selectionism]] and [[20230307200456|A New Definition of Luddism]].
