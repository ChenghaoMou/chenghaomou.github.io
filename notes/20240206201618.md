Symptoms:
- A fake sense of socialising with Internet interactions;
- A fake sense of busy, productive, or secure, living on autopilot with constant distractions or stimulus;
- Withdrawal symptoms like anxiety, insomnia, and intense aggressiveness[^1].

By design, recommendation systems can't distinguish between addictive and high-quality content — there isn't enough compute can equate to human-level discernment and curation at scale. This inevitably push the users further into someplace bad whom might already struggle with insecurity[^1] [^3].

This is no easy way to break from all social media when everyone you know is confined to the same platform. Even if you are not on the platform, you would certainly feel the pressure from your peers. The cost of switching, or briefly leave can feel immensely intimidating[^2].

Prescription:
- Exercise, even a small dose, can change the brain chemistry to help you combat the negative thoughts.
- Socialise with families and friends in real life.
