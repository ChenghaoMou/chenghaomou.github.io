# Daily Standup is Overrated

Inspiration: [[20240209203616|The “3 standup questions” are terrible and need to die – More Than Coding]]

The common practice of daily standup revolves around three questions:
1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What will I focus on today?
3. What blockers do I have?

It is productiveless as [[20230902132142|Return-to-Office]] mandate — a return-to-team-meeting practice that fosters a mindset of batch processing where communication is often delayed until the standup or follow-ups that could have been initated any time before the standup.

It is necessary only because the progress isn't availabel or transparent enough by poor management or engineering culture. Constant reports will only disrupt the flow of the engineers and add more pressure in addition to the actual work.
