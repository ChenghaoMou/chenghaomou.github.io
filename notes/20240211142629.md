# AI and Education

Talking about use or disuse of technologies like ChatGPT is mostly a distraction[^1] [^2].

If the focus of our modern education system is purely results-driven — multiple choices, essays, or grades — then it doesn't matter if students are using ChatGPT or a calculator. Even when the models magically synthesise an explanation, correctly, comprehending the explanation does not equal to coming up with a solution by your own reasoning[^3]. The short-circuiting in learning to learn will cast a long shadow in our future generations — we should never train our students to be input and output mapping machines[^2]. Not to mention the fact that these models are often released without proper regulation and testing[^4], and errors are often dismissed as benign hallucination.

The fact students are rushing to those tools for their homework is an example of how society has failed our next generation: both teachers and students are not critically equipped to judge the use of such tools. Most of the conversations regarding AI in education has been reactive by banning or embracing the technology. Rarely are discussed questions like what it is, what problems it creates or solves, how to teach students to become aware of the limitations, or any other technology for that matter[^5] [^6].

Education is unique in a sense that it has always been underfunded and caught up with technological development when almost all technocrats want to repay their societal duty debt by introducing their technology into the classroom, thinking it would magically solve all the problems.

The following is an excerpt from [[20240411222530|More collegiate FOMO • Buttondown]] where Prof. Emily Bender expresses her ideal response an university should issue when it comes to AI and I think it captures nicely what we should expect from education:
