# AI and Education

Talking about use or disuse of technologies like ChatGPT is mostly a distraction[^1].

If the focus of our modern education system is purely results-driven — multiple choices, essays, or grades — then it doesn't matter if students are using ChatGPT or a calculator. Even when the models magically synthesize an explanation, correctly, comprehending the explannation does not euqal to coming up with a solution by your own reasoning[^2]. The short-circuiting in learning to learn will cast a long shadow in our future generations.

The fact students are rushing to those tools for their homework is an example of how society has failed our next generation: both teachers and students are not critically equipped to judge the use of such tools. Most of the conversations regarding AI in education has been reactive by banning or embracing the techonology. Rarely discussed are questions like what it is, what problems it creates or solves, how to teach students to become aware of the limitations, or any other techonology for that matter[^3] [^4].

Education is unique in a sense that it has always been underfunded and caught up with technological development when almost all technocrats want to repay their societal duty debt by introducing their techonology into the classroom, thinking it would magically solve all the problems.
