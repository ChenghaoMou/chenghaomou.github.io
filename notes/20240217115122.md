A new variant of [[20240217101251|State Space Model]] where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are input-dependent and thus time-varying.

$$
\begin{align}
h_t &= s_{\bar{A}}(x_t)h_{t - 1} + s_\bar{B}(x_t)x_t\\
y_t &= s_C(x_t)h_t
\end{align}
$$

Such change renders the convolutional formulation impossible since each time step requires different parameters. However, such sequential calculation can be remedied by scan algorithm or a prefix sum, compound with hardware-aware implementation utilising memory hierarchy, and kernel fusions.

## Scan Algorithm

To calculate the hidden state in parallel, we can use the following step to illustrate the idea:

$$
\begin{align}
h_t &= s_{\bar{A}}(x_t)h_{t - 1} + s_\bar{B}(x_t)x_t\\
&=s_{\bar{A}}(x_t)(s_{\bar{A}}(x_{t-1})h_{t - 2} + s_\bar{B}(x_{t-1})x_{t-1}) + s_\bar{B}(x_t)x_t\\
&=s_{\bar{A}}(x_t)s_{\bar{A}}(x_{t-1})h_{t - 2} + s_{\bar{A}}(x_t)s_\bar{B}(x_{t-1})x_{t-1} + s_\bar{B}(x_t)x_t\\
\end{align}
$$

we can calculate $s_{\bar{A}}(x_t)s_{\bar{A}}$, $s_{\bar{A}}(x_t)s_\bar{B}(x_{t-1})x_{t-1}$, and $s_\bar{B}(x_t)x_t$ first while $h_{t-2}$ is being calculated elsewhere in a different thread/core. This can also be illustrated with the following prefix-sum graph:

Furthermore, recalculation of the activation is also used to save the memory load.
