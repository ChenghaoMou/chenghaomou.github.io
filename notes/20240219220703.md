Software built on VC investments. VC money can subsidise the cost during the early stage to attract and lock-in users, e.g. by holding their data or social network hostage. Eventually, VCware has more pressure to answer the stakeholders instead of its users. Priorities shift, prices increases, and functionality decreases.
