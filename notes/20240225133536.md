Source: [[20240224094409|No, RAG is probably not going to rescue the current situation]]

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) doesnâ€™t guarantee more factuality in the generation. Robust and reliable generation, even when the source materials are present, is still an unsolved problem.

The generation might be more correlated to the data source, but such correlation has nothing to do with truth, nor causality.
