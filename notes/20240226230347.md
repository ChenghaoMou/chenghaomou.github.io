There are three types of formulations for the Shirky Principle:
1. **Institutions** will try to preserve the problem to which *they are the solution*, implying intentionality.
2. **Complex solutions** can become so absorbed in the problem they are solving that they **inadvertently** perpetuate the problem as an *unintentional consequence*.
3. Every **entity** will prolong the problem it is solving, regardless of their intentions.

More generally, we can express the shirky principle as "Entities often promote problems that they benefit from".

In conjunction, two other useful ideas can also be referenced together with the Shirky Principle:
1. **Cui bono**: a latin phrase meaning "who benefits?". It suggests that it is likely whoever is responsible for an event is most likely to benefit from it. This draws a similar connection between the problem and the beneficiary.
2. **Hanlon's razoe** — never attribute to malice when it can be explained adequately by stupidity. This can be used to refer to the intention part mentioned above.
