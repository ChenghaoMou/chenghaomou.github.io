# On Giving Up On Github

Inspiration: [Give Up GitHub - Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/)

To choice a service is to invest in it over others. Just like how we build our habits around our identity, we choose a platform not just because it has a better quality or reach, but what value it stands for and what kind of future it represents[^1].

When Github does not practise what it preaches by choosing to close source its platform, takes our collective contribution without consent and acknowledgement and demands a paid subscription, we should know it is time to give up on Github.

It could be a slow and painful experience. But the pain today pales in comparison to a [[20240105204049|Techno-Feudalism]] tomorrow â€” a tomorrow we could have built with a much better transparent alternative without sacrificing our rights or our code.
