# The Internet Was Problematic Before, and Now It Will Be Forever

The synthetic output we see today from generative models is often modelled from materials collected from the open Internet, mostly from the Anglosphere, with a cut-off date.

Recent issues emerged from Gemini[^1] [^2] and others[^3] demonstrated how a model can be **influenced by human decision-makers and the data that powered them**. Even more so, by the **downstream abusers**[^4][^5]. Unfortunately, all the guardrails deployed as an afterthought have never solved the problem[^9] [^10].

If people who actually have the power to fight it is actively contributing to such entrenchment of the bias and misinformation, then what hope do we have[^6] [^7] [^8]?
