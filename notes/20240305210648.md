# The Internet Was Biased Before, and Now It Will Be Forever

The synthetic output we see today from generative models is often modelled from materials collected on the open Internet, mostly from the Anglosphere, with a cut-off date.

Recent issues we notice from Gemini[^1] [^2] and others[^3] demonstrated how a model can be **influenced by human decision-makers and the data that powered them**. Even more so, by the downstream abusers[^4][^5]. Unfortunately, all the guardrails deployed as an afterthought can never solve the problem.

If people who actually have the power to fight it is actively contributing to such bias, then what hope do we have?
