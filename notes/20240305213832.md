# Will Open Internet Become a Past?

I can't stop wondering whether this paradigm shift, which was introduced by AI where companies are scrambling to leverage or sell their customer data in bundle and web crawlers gorging on the open internet like there is no tomorrow, would lead to a more closed internet.

Some will still hold the hope for a diverse internet future, despite the possibility of losing one's identity[^1]. Some will fight against corporate or abusers who are taking all the benefits. Some may decide to move away from building in public. It will be interesting to see how this will play out.
