# Moat

The real moat those big tech companies have is the means of computation[^1] [^2] — expensive GPU clusters, data, and talents.

This sad reality makes open sourcing large model weight less appealing because only a handful of companies hold enough compute power to leverage those models, and most of them are competitors. If they benefit from such model release, few of them would acknowledge it, not to mention returning the favour.
