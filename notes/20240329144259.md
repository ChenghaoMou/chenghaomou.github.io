# Refusal as an Act of Design

When it comes to data privacy and data rights, choices are not enough. **Equally accessible and carefully thought-out choices** should be the bare minimum, along with [[20230725083514|A Default No to Something New]].

By refusal, especially in the presence of insatiable surveillance and data harvesting, it creates room for alternatives and asserts inclusion, which should have been considered early on if all voices were invited and heard.

## Refusal Design Aspects
Each aspect is a spectrum with varying effects: some might cause seismic socio-technical changes while some hardly make a dent.
1. Autonomy: individuals and organisations can each take different approaches in response to such issues, such as opt-out, class-action lawsuit, boycott, and legislation.
2. Time: lawsuits can be launched for past and present harm, and legistation can prevent future harm.
3. Power: legistation usually has more power and control over corporation behaviors than individual actions.
4. Cost: with great power comes great cost. Some measures might take years and many back-and-forth legal and political battles.
