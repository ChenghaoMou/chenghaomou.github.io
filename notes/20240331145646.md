We often joked about how AI can't replace software engineers because then PMs would have to be very specific about their requirements which aren’t so different from the actual programming by that time. I believe it’s the same for writing — it can’t take your job just because it can extrude some meaningful sentences.

To delegate writing to decision-making automation systems, AI or not, it requires you to understand how it works and where it’s most applicable, like any other instruments we humans have wielded before. To better collaborate, we now have to **plan, think, and reason better** instead of letting those models cut all the corners. We should also prioritise more human connections and community forming[^2]. If not, then we aren't necessarily improving, we’re just lazier, cheaper and easily replaceable.

> Only if you know what you want and understand what you’re doing, can you use your tools appropriately to achieve the results you desire[^1].
