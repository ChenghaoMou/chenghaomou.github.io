# Steal When You Can and Distract When You Do

![[Pasted image 20240407131127.png]]

When I looked into the first few rows of a LLM dataset called RefinedWeb, it is immediately obvious that terms of those websites were violated:
## 100parts.wordpress.com
The first record in the dataviewer. Original link: [ast/ray (Baden-Baden, day 31) – once upon each day](http://100parts.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/astray-baden-baden-day-31/)

[Legal and Privacy Page](https://100parts.wordpress.com/impressum-privacy-policy/) states:
> Sämtliche Texte und Bilder sind urheberrechtlich geschützt. Verwendung nur mit schriftlicher Genehmigung.

Google translate in English:
> All texts and images are protected by copyright. Use only with written permission.

## 1037theloon.com
The forth record in the dataset viewer. The second one is not accessible anymore and the third one does not contain any license or legal links. Original link: [Scorpions \> 103.7 THE LOON](http://1037theloon.com/tags/scorpions/)

The footer:
> 2024 103.7 THE LOON[, Townsquare Media, Inc](https://www.townsquaremedia.com). All rights reserved.

The [terms](https://1037theloon.com/terms/):
> Townsquare owns and retains all proprietary rights in the Websites. The Websites contains copyrighted material, trademarks, and other proprietary information of Townsquare. Except for that information which is in the public domain or for which you have been given written permission, you may not copy, modify, publish, transmit, distribute, perform, display, or sell any such proprietary information. RSS feeds may be republished so long as they are not modified in any way.

This is enough demonstration of how double-standarded people are in terms of data rights. As soon as one slaps the "to be trained for LLM" label on the content one illegally acquired, one is free to use, to distribute, to re-license, and to profit from it[^1]. All has and will be forgiven in the name of progress. Too bad [[20240220222025|robots.txt]] is not a law, am I right?

To steal is not enough too. Being a large enough tech company also means you have resources to ward yourself off potential scrutiny and attention, such as releasing policy updates during the holidays[^1], hiding AI data usage updates behind legalese and UI dark patterns, or lobbying against legistation that could threaten your profits.
