# Engagement Dilemma

For an AI feature to be engaging, it has to be excellent. But it also means it needs a lot of good engagement data to begin with ([[20240417203752|Facebook’s AI Told Parents Group It Has a Gifted, Disabled Child]]).

For the predictable future, users for most AI products will be guinea pigs and enjoy the free labour exploitation whether they buy in this distant future or not[^1]. It’s also fascinating to see how intolerant we’re towards some AI products like Humane AI Pin[^2] while welcoming others. Is there a unanimous threshold that I’m not aware of?
