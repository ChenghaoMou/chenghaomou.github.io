# Engagement Dilemma

For an AI feature to be engaging, it has to be excellent. But it also means it needs a lot of good engagement data to begin with ([[20240417203752|Facebook’s AI Told Parents Group It Has a Gifted, Disabled Child]]).

For the predictable future, users for most AI products will be guinea pigs and enjoy the free labour exploitation whether they buy in the distant future or not[^1]. Companies will also be motivated to get models or products out of the gate as soon as possible in response to mounting pressure from investors. The case against thoughtful and deliberate crafting and safety considerations is strong when profits and returns are on the table[^2].

It’s also fascinating to see how intolerant we’re towards some AI products like Humane AI Pin while welcoming others[^3] .
