# Practise and Understanding

For humans, understanding a math or science idea is simple, but mastering it requires practice and repetition — aka rote efforts. It is easy for a student to claim "I understand this" and proceed to fail a test because understanding the gist can create an illusion of competence[^2].

This resembles how note taking or rephrasing plays an important role in the learning process[^1]. The efforts we make to wrangle unspoken ideas and concepts deepen our grasp as a consequence.

This seems like a direct contradiction with [[20230807135404|Language Fluency Fallacy]], but again for proper reasons: the subject of such fluency differs— one is a machine and one is human. We seem to have two opposite mechanisms when it comes to "learning" here — humans need extensive practice and repetition to reinforce the knowledge and understanding, while machines require massive data and endless training cycles to have some amount of "generalisation/understanding".
