# AI Product UX

Maybe the original version or pain point it tries to solve remains the same, the model quirks inevitably eat the entire UX and users end up as model sitters â€” realising that the product is only good for certain use cases and nothing else[^1].  It would be perfectly fine it was touted as a specific tool solving specific problems and it delievered, but often times it didn't and what ends up being sold is more of hope and promise.

One has to learn to trust the product, warranted or not, and to delegate decision-making to the model because otherwise it becomes pointless.
