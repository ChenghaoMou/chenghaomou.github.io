# The Down Fall of Web Crawls

As a consequence of the [[20230730185747|Oil Spill in Our Information Ecosystem]] and the rise of copyright consciousness of human labour, the web crawl corpus will eventually become less valuable and noisier with low-quality synthetic text, as conjectured in [[20240502222525|Snowflake Arctic Cookbook Series: Arcticâ€™s Approach to Data]]. Website owners are also starting to combat AI crawlers with the semi-dysfunctional robots.txt convention, even though it does not hold any water in a court. Additionally, companies are also creating new user agents for their AI bots, seemingly to circumvent such limits[^1].
