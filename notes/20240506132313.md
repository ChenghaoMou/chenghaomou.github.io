# Corporate Open Source Rug Pull

A rug pull is typically used to describe a financial crime (usually related to cryptocurrency or NFT) where developers abandon the project and take investors' money.

This is what happening to corporate open-source projects: they were initially released under open-source licenses, gathered a huge community and built an entire ecosystem. Then suddenly the company changes the license for profits, leaving the community high and dry. One early sign of such behaviour is the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)[^1].
