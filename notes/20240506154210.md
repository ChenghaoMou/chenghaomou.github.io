# AI and Software Engineering

Testing software is hard, especially with bugs stemming from confusion of specifications or customer requests.

AI today doesn’t have the right context or the ability to handle such context aptly to address such issues. Not even humans can navigate those situations with ease: there will be endless planning meetings, debates, quarrels and iterative design changes with unforeseen consequences emerging from the actual implementation.

Software engineering in essence is understanding **the domain and the problem** and building the solution to solve it[^1]. Coding and testing are actually the straightforward part once such understanding is clear. In this case, AI helping us with the technical execution or testing may become just the right opportunity for us to become better at planning and critical thinking.
