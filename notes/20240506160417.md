# Inference Drift

To be faithfully reliable when synthesising text with various requirements, the model needs to balance the task at hand but also the goals and requirements in "mind" for the given context limit and inference compute limits[^1]. It can do a terrible job at answering any question but holding true to its guardrails like [GOODY-2](https://www.goody2.ai/), but also spill gibberish with the right prompts. Reliability then is more like **a Pareto curve** varying in different situations and domains.
