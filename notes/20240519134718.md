# AI Search and SEO

Having immediate access to accurate and high-quality information, generated by AI or not, right at your fingertip sounds at odds with the ad and SEO business.

If the current search results are so bad that every search company has to place AI produced slop to provide a "better" user experience, what does it say about their previous approaches[^1]?

What difference does it make if people still have to discern sponsored ads from real high-quality information?
