# AI Search Slop and Piracy

Search engines nowadays are all transitioning to answer engines that promise better and quicker answers to your queries. Yet, we see emergent failure patterns with such integration:

## 1. Lack of factual understanding of the text;

Some even termed the unwanted synthetic results "slop" [^1], reminiscent of email spams. Model hallucination is one thing, which hasn't been solved yet, but assuming everything the model sees or was trained on is factually correct sounds more like human hallucination. If the current search results are so bad that every search company has to place AI produced slop to provide a "better" user experience, what does it say about the experience of the internet has become, no thanks to them[^2]?

## 2. Lack of respect for copyright and labor;

The shift in value proposition from providing sources to information to providing information directly is now also cutting off the lifeline for journalists and other website owners[^3]. Adding salt to the injury, bots are coming for the content as well[^4].

Will there be inserted ads as well in the synthetic answers[^5]? What difference does it make if people still have to discern sponsored ads from other made up answers?
