# Start with Metrics

Outcome-driven development needs clear distinction between failure and success, and the way to define such differentiation is by metrics first [^2] [^3].

Keep in mind the difference between metrics and goals: goals are the northen stars and metrics help us validate we have arrived. Metrics aren't always perfect and sometimes they are the only approximation we get, thus it is important not to chase metrics as goals[^1] with distorted efforts.
