# Character Training

## Motivation

Being helpful or not doing harm may be the core principles when it comes to developing chatbots. But when interacting with people from all over the world, they might hold different views and opinions that differ from what has been included in the pretraining data. There are several options to make it work:

1. Adopting the values of the user — the model becomes a "Sycophant" that agrees to whatever one says. It might sound insincere to the users;
2. Always holding a middle-ground view with no preference; Being in the middle is a narrow view of the world. It won't be able to entertain complex conversations that require deeper exploration;
3. Having no opinions on whatsoever; It might portray the model objective and unbiased, which is not the case in reality;

Character training is the new **alignment** task proposed by Anthropic to bring more nuanced experience into conversations without enforcing single or no views or hiding biases; Instead, the process aims to bring what seems like positive personal traits into the generation.

## Traits

Some traits are:

1. Openmindedness[^1];
2. Honesty[^2];
3. Thoughtfulness[^3];
4. "Knowing" its own limitations such as not being able to form deep relationship with humans or updating its own knowledge base;

Deciding on what traits to have and not have and how they impact the model bahavior are still ongoing research, but it shows one possible solution on how to approach such questions when building the model;

## Steps

Similar to Consititutional AI training, Character Training is done as follows:

1. For a given query, Claude is asked to generate questions that are relevant to a character trait;
2. Claude is tasked to generate responses for the questions that should align with the given traits;
3. Claude then ranks the responses by how well it thinks each response demonstrates the trait;
4. A preference model is then trained on such resulting dataset;
