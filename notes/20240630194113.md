# Emergent Behaviour

Originally proposed in [[Characterizing Emergent Phenomena in Large Language Models|Characterizing Emergent Phenomena in Large Language Models]], it describes the phenomenon where model performance **spikes** when it reaches a certain scale.

However, such evaluation jump stems mostly from the discontinuous metric used such as exact string match where getting closer to the correct answer is penalized as getting it wrong[^1]. With that being said, giving partial credit or softening the metric may not always be ideal when it comes to real-world use cases, the emergence of the performance jump may still holds as long as the metric is indeed fair.
