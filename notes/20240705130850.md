# Multiple Labels VS Multiple Rounds

In the data labelling world, especially with multi-label scenarios, one usually have two options:

1. Label each instance with all the labels (maybe with some hierarchy if supported);
2. Label each instance with one label or small group of labels and label the same dataset multiple times to collect all annotation.

Option 2 sounds tedious, but real experiments [^1] [^2] have shown that it is actually faster because of the reduced cognitive load. Maybe it is also why assemble lines require each worker to focus on one small job only — handling different context is more costly than multiple rounds.
