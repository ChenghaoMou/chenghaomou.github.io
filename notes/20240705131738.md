# BM42

A new retrieval method proposed by Qdrant[^1].

Compared with BM25, BM45 improves on the term frequency component by leveraging attention scores from any transformer model â€” assuming self-attention captures better token importance than simple statistics:

$$
\text{score}(D, Q) = \sum_{i=1}^N\text{IDF}(q_i) \times \text{Attention}(\text{CLS}, q_i)
$$

where `CLS` row is used to compute the final token importance for a given document, averaged over multiple heads. $q_i$ refers to the token in the query that also appears in the document.

The motivation behind this change:

1. RAG systems use short text snippet where term frequency could no longer serve its purpose because they are all small numbers when the length is short;
2. Other types of improvement over BM25 are either too slow or two complex;

BM45 offers the flexibility to choose any transformer models and reserves the interpretability from the token/word level. And one can choose to go with a larger model if more performance is desired.
