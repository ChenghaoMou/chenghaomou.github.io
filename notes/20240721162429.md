# Steel Man Technique

A version of help you help me by reinforcing the opponent's argumentâ€”building the best version of their side so they can bring the best counter-argument to yours[^1].

This forces you to think deeply about your own stance and to challenge yourself with a "better" opponent while developing a deeper understanding of the other side.

Outside the context of debate, this can be useful in drafting writings where one's arguments can be attacked by improving attackers.
