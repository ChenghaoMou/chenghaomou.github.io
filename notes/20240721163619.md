# Courage

It takes courage to face setbacks and resist dwelling on being insecure again and again. It is the only way to learn battle-tested lessons and feedback loop that can put you on a better course of action.

The only way to find out if a plan works is to put it into action, and let the evidence tell you what a better version would be[^1]. The next one doesn't have to be perfect either, as long as you are strategise your plans based on the feedback, you will end up better and better plans and results, significantly better than sitting idly with a dream.
