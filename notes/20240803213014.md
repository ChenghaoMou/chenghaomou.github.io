# LLM Speed Metrics

Sources: [[Benchmarking LLM Inference Backends|Benchmarking LLM Inference Backends]]

Speed metrics are often used to measure deployment frameworks and platforms. Common metrics are:

1. **Time to First Token (TTFT)**: it measures the time from the receiving of the request to the generation of the first token, usually measured in milliseconds.
2. **Time between Tokens (TBT)**: it measures the time spent between each generation step. Mathematically, it is equivalent to **Token Generation Rate (TGR)** which measures how many tokens were generated per second during inference.
