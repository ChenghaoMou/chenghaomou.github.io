# Advice

Source: [[Why doesn’t advice work-|Why doesn’t advice work?]]

Advice can be hard to swallow. Here are some reasons why it is difficult to follow an advice:
1. Limited practicality due to different life experience;
2. Too difficult to be understood;
3. Different expectations and views make people bet different wagers on the same advice, related to #1;
4. Too many prerequisites, related to #2;
5. People who seek advice might have a preconceived answer already — they are simply looking for validation;
6. The underlying problem that caused the person to ask for advice might be the same reason why they couldn't follow it through;
