# Venturing Out

In a work setting, all-day Zoom or all-day office both sound extreme. We need some amount of serendipity as well as focus time to maximise our productivity.

So does our life. We need to leave the house to experience what makes it worth living. We need the social connection to build lasting friendship. We need to search, dream and desire to work with the world we cannot control[^1] â€” The act of engagement is what shapes the reality[^2].

So does our communication. We need to write, to produce, and to share so that we can collect feedback and then improve.

So does our big plans and goals. We need to carry them out before knowing what sticks and what the steps should be.

It takes [[20240721163619|Courage]] for sure, espeically when you are an introvert[^3], to venture out, to feel vulnerable, but that is what makes it beautiful[^4] [^5].
