# Space Shuttle Style Programming

A practice that involves writing highly verbose (matching if-else statements) and well-documented code. Originally, [the conversation around this topic](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18772873) was ignited by the [Kubernetes codebase](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ec2e767e59395376fa191d7c56a74f53936b7653/pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume/pv_controller.go#L55). 

However, a closer look into the space shuttle engineering culture reveals a more nuanced story[^1] — the process in which they develop the software makes the software great, not the code itself. This reminds me of the saying in [[31554998|Atomic Habits]]: "*You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.*"

1. They meticulously plan for the product to a point where the spec becomes the blueprint — you can either follow it wholeheartedly or change it with great efforts;
2. The rivalry between the developers and QA engineers makes the product robust. This resembles the chaos engineering done at Netflix. A little adversary goes a long way.
3. Mistakes are manifestation of deeper issues, so fixing root causes is how the process can be improved.
