# Benchmark Reporting

Source: [[Can You Trust An AI Press Release-|Can You Trust An AI Press Release?]]

Watch out how companies are reporting their benchmark results and what they are omitting:

1. Does it include all subsets of a benchmark? If not, what subsets are excluded?
2. Are they using the same evaluation set-up (e.g. temperature, no. of shots, w/ o w/o CoT)?
3. Are they citing reported numbers instead of results from the latest model? (Companies often release model updates without updating the evaluation results, seemingly to create performance jumps for future releases)
