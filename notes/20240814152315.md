# Inversion

Maybe you don't know the solution to a problem, but you might have a better chance thinking about what isn't. Approaching a problem from the opposite angle often reveals surprising insights that can be leveraged to avoid mistakes[^1].

Comparably, people also use **minimising regret** as their life motto instead of something like achieving greatness or becoming wealthy as regrets are more tangibly recognisable and easier to be avoided.
