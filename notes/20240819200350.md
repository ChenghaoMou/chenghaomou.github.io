# Powered by AI is Putting Customers Off

Customers are turned off by the mentioning of AI in products because of two associated risks: one from high expectation of AI to be free of errors — like what we have with computers or calculators ([[20230807135404|Language Fluency Fallacy]]), and another one because of privacy concerns: We have seen companies steal and models plagiarise without consequences ([[20240108194414|AI Plagiarism]], [[20240407125740|Steal When You Can and Distract When You Do]]), there is no guarantee that they will hold themselves to higher standards when it comes to the customer data, not to mention that fact that governments are still in the early stage of regulating AI.
