# Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast

This mantra, often used by Navy SEALs, emphasises on accuracy and deliberation over speed. Careful consideration and mindful actions make the process a smooth transition where mistakes are less likely to occur[^1].

This seems at odds with Facebook's "move fast and break things" principle. It's mentally challenging to reconcile these two competing mantras, especially when both proponents are experts in their fields. From a cost perspective, it makes sense to move fast when the cost of mistakes is relatively small compared to the learnings. Conversely, it's better to move slowly when the cost of mistakes is higher. This approach aligns well with the stages a start-up goes through. In the beginning, a mistake affects fewer customers, and corrections and lessons can be made quickly. As the company grows, the potential disruption a small mistake can cause to users and revenue might outweigh any benefits of quick action. Unfortunately, this seems to imply the inevitability of [[20231112144602|The Innovatorâ€™s Dilemma]]. Maybe the answer to these types of problems shall always return to striking a balance?
