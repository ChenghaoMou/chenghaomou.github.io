# The Competition is with Yourself

With the advent of social media, the comparison has never been easier. But the truth is, we don't know other people's backgrounds or what brought them to where they are now. So, it's hard to make a fair comparison. The only fair comparison is with ourselves because we know our own circumstances and efforts[^1].
