# Contextual Communication

Source: [[No -Hello-, No -Quick Call-, and no Meetings Without an Agenda|No "Hello", No "Quick Call", and no Meetings Without an Agenda]]

When initiating a conversation in a remote work setting or over the internet, it's important to set-up the context to facilitate the understanding, namely:
1. Providing details and timelines, especially the original output and source code in a technical scenario. This is to avoid redundant efforts and to narrow the scope as soon as possible;
2. Get rid of the handshake protocols. Unless Slack is suddenly dropping messages out of nowhere, there is no need to use handshake protocols in human-to-human communication. It's already done at the network level!
3. Making efforts. It seems trivial to set up a meeting invitation without agenda or sending a slack quick greeting, but the mental load of having to jump out of one's context to read am ambiguous message is even more taxing. Show people your efforts, no matter how small it seems.
