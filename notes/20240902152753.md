# Code Refactoring

Source: [[Good Refactoring vs Bad Refactoring|Good Refactoring vs Bad Refactoring]]

1. Incremental changes: Introduce changes incrementally and frequently to allow thorough testing and review with minimal effort.
2. Understand before acting: The codebase is a living entity. Knowing its capabilities and workings before making significant changes minimizes disruption.
3. Maintain a consistent style and format, whether refactoring or not.
4. Avoid adding dependencies without justification.
5. Add tests for the code if none exist before refactoring to ensure feature parity and compatibility.
6. Foster an engineering culture that ensures accountability.
