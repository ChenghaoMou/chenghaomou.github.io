## Deductive Reasoning

Given a rule, maybe with a few examples (few-shot), can you apply the same logic to new data? This is a typical setting for LLMs when prompted with some initial setup.

## Inductive Reasoning

Given a few examples, can you infer the rule? This is generalisation based on observations. This can be tricky depending on how you expect the model to behave:
- applying the generalisation implicitly to new problems (this blurs the line between deduction and inductive reasoning)
- explicitly generate the rule in a format that can be executed externally (thus free of deductive influence from sequence generation)

The second option is the main topic of the paper where SolverLearner is proposed to evaluate such inductive reasoning of an LLM model.

Based on the experiments, deductive reasoning seems to be more challenging and models gain more from inductive reasoning.
