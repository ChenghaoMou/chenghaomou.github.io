# Art is about Agency

Source: [[Why A.I. Isn’t Going to Make Art|Why A.I. Isn’t Going to Make Art]]

To create is to endure the countless decision-making opportunities, and to delegate such power to an automated system is taking a cheap shortcut — the significance of an art resides in the efforts made and the desire expressed by the artist [[20240205214602|Cult AI]].

Automating our creation, whether useful or not, is to give up our agency in hope to gain some efficiency in the final results. It disregards the process, let alone less tangible gains like knowledge or skills — just like how corporates profit without any respect for human labor. In pursuit of better productivity or profitability with such technologies, we are giving up chances to become better humans.
