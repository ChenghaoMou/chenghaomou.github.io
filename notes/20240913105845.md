# The Irony of Automation

Also known as the Automation Paradox — when the automation system becomes more sophisticated and capable, the human operators become less skilled and vigilant to unexpected situations. [Ironies of automation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0005109883900468)

We might be witnessing this concept unfolding in real-time with the advent of a slew of programming copilots. Early on, signs of [[20240519165350|Copilot Pause]] indicate how dependent programmers may become for simple auto completions, but with the increasing capabilities of those systems and seemingly more accurate results and assigned agency, we might become much worse than we expected in terms of programming and critical thinking — those machines might not take our jobs, but they are sure taking our chances to learn and practice[^1]. If previously, companies are taking control over the means of computation[^2], their models now might be taking over our means of thinking.

We are heading into a future where one can claim they are better at programming because of AI, but in reality they are better at prompting AI or reviewing AI than programming/crafting itself. Those are very different skillsets and mindsets.
