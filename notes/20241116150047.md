# The Growth Mindset

The issue with a growth mindset is that it's hard to define or measure clearly. This gives managers the freedom to interpret it in their own way. Often, this means they might prioritize their own goals over respecting employees' dignity and individuality[^1].

Just like cancer grows endlessly with enough resources, a poorly defined growth mindset culture can become harmful if not properly managed.
