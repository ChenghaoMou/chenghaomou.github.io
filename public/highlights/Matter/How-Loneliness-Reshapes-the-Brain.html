<p><mark>As the researchers described in 2019, in comparison to a control group, the socially isolated team lost volume in their prefrontal cortex — the region at the front of the brain, just behind the forehead, that is chiefly responsible for decision-making and problem-solving. They also had lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein that nurtures the development and survival of nerve cells in the brain. The reduction persisted for at least a month and a half after the team’s return from Antarctica.</mark></p>
<p><mark>While we desire connection with others, we view them as unreliable, judgmental and unfriendly. Consequently, we keep our distance, consciously or unconsciously spurning potential opportunities for connections.</mark></p>
<p><mark>“The core features of social anxiety were not evident in loneliness,” Lieberz said. Those results suggest, she said, that treating loneliness simply by telling lonely people to go out and socialize more (the way you can treat a phobia of snakes with exposure) will often not work because it fails to address the root cause of the loneliness.</mark></p>
<p><mark>The problem with loneliness seems to be that it biases our thinking. In behavioral studies, lonely people picked up on negative social signals, such as images of rejection, within 120 milliseconds — twice as quickly as people with satisfying relationships and in less than half the time it takes to blink. Lonely people also preferred to stand farther away from strangers, trusted others less and disliked physical touch.</mark></p>
<p><mark>This may be why the emotional well-being of lonely individuals often follows “a downward spiral,” said Danilo Bzdok, an interdisciplinary researcher at McGill University with a background in neuroscience and machine learning. “They tend to end up with a more negative spin on whatever information they receive — facial expressions, texting, whatever — and that drives them even deeper into this loneliness pit.”</mark></p>
<p><mark>They looked separately at socially isolated people and at people with low social support, as measured by a lack of someone to confide in on a daily or almost daily basis. The researchers found that in all such individuals, the orbitofrontal cortex — a part of the brain linked to processing rewards — was smaller.</mark></p>
<p><mark>This finding supports previous reports from eye-tracking studies that lonely people tend to focus excessively on unpleasant social cues, such as being ignored by others.</mark></p>
<p><mark>To Tomova, the experiment underlined an important truth about loneliness: If just 10 hours without social contact is enough to elicit essentially the same neural signals as being deprived of food, “it highlights how basic our need to connect with others is,” she said.</mark></p>
<p><mark>“That might be a reason why lonely people have problems trusting others — they cannot rely on their [gut] feelings,” she said. Interventions that target trust could therefore be part of a solution to the catch-22 of loneliness.</mark></p>
<p><mark>Another idea is to encourage synchrony. Research shows that one key to how much people like and trust each other lies in how closely their behaviors and reactions match from moment to moment. This synchrony between individuals can be as simple as reciprocating a smile or mirroring body language during conversation, or as elaborate as singing in a choir or being part of a rowing team. In a study published a year ago, Lieberz and her colleagues showed that lonely people struggle to synchronize with others, and that this discordance causes the regions of their brain responsible for observing actions to go into overdrive. Coaching lonely people in how to join in with the actions of others could be another strategic intervention to consider. It won’t cure loneliness by itself, “but it may be a starting point,” Lieberz said.</mark></p></article></div><div class="sidebar right"><div class="backlinks"><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class="overflow"><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div></div></div><footer class=""><hr><p>Created with <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">Quartz v4.2.3</a> © 2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://codeberg.org/Chenghao2023/blog">CodeBerg</a></li><li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.9/contrib/copy-tex.min.js" type="application/javascript"></script><script type="application/javascript">function c(){let t=this.parentElement;t.classList.toggle("is-collapsed");let l=t.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?this.scrollHeight:t.scrollHeight;t.style.maxHeight=l+"px";let o=t,e=t.parentElement;for(;e;){if(!e.classList.contains("callout"))return;let n=e.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?e.scrollHeight:e.scrollHeight+o.scrollHeight;e.style.maxHeight=n+"px",o=e,e=e.parentElement}}function i(){let t=document.getElementsByClassName("callout is-collapsible");for(let s of t){let l=s.firstElementChild;if(l){l.addEventListener("click",c),window.addCleanup(()=>l.removeEventListener("click",c));let e=s.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?l.scrollHeight:s.scrollHeight;s.style.maxHeight=e+"px"}}}document.addEventListener("nav",i);window.addEventListener("resize",i);
