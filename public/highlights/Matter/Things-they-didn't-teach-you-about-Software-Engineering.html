<p><mark>Professional software developers work in groups and on small pieces of a large software code base, and more often than not — it’s fixing stuff rather than building it from scratch. It’s not as glamorous as the boot camps tend to portray it, and there’s much more overhead involved than just coding.</mark></p>
<p><mark>This is not necessarily learned in a classroom setting but rather through practical experience and the realization of the time and effort that can be saved by having documentation and writing easy-to-understand code.</mark></p>
<p><mark>Although it may sound surprising, the primary focus of a software engineer’s job is not writing code but rather creating value through the use of software that was written. Code is simply a tool to achieve this end goal. Code <span>→</span> Software <span>→</span> Value.</mark></p>
<p><mark>Elegant code, best practices, smart solutions, design patterns — these are done for the sake of your fellow software engineers who will work on the codebase after you rather than helping you fulfill the purpose of bringing value. (Mind you, bringing value can also mean building a scalable solution that doesn’t crash, which requires the code to be at least somewhat decent.)</mark></p>
<p><mark>The big lie that they tell you in university is that your project manager will give you proper, structured, simple instructions on what needs to be done, and then you code it. “Draw a Mandelbrot” or “Render a Rabbit mesh with ambient occlusion.” At the end of the day, you have a solution, and you high-five your manager and go home smiling. What is going to happen is that your PO will come to you with a rough outline of the task “We need something that will take us from point A to point B, but we don’t have any designs yet, and the third-party integrations will not be delivered until we tell them what we want and Boss X wants it to be Red and Boss Y wants it to be Green.” And this is where the “real job” of a software engineer starts — gathering requirements, figuring out what needs to be done. Requirements gathering isn’t the easy part of programming. It’s not as fun as writing code. But it takes a considerable amount of your time as a programmer because it requires working with people, not machines — calling the agency that provides the third-party integration, and chatting with their developers to understand what’s feasible and what’s not. Sitting down with the stakeholders to tell them their ideas do not make sense and that we can do it this way and not that way.</mark></p>
<p><mark>But the truth is — We can never be entirely sure that our code, libraries, or even hardware will not fail at some point; on the contrary, we need to assume it will. Even smart people are just people.</mark></p>
<p><mark>Aesthetics in software development refers to the overall look and feel of the code. It’s about how easy it is to read, understand, and maintain. Aesthetically pleasing code is clean, organized, and follows logical patterns. It’s the kind of code that makes you feel good when you look at it. Or makes you cringe when it’s terrible. Unfortunately, aesthetics can’t be taught in a one-semester course. It’s gained through experience and reading a lot of good code as well as maintaining bad code.</mark></p>
<p><mark>Meetings are there to ensure that everything is going smoothly and on schedule. They align people around a shared goal and keep everyone on track. The marketing department is aware that something is being developed, and they can prepare for the eventual release of the feature. Project Managers see what direction the developers are working towards and do a slight course correction if needed. Customer support brings updates from the user-facing side. Quality assurance shares their findings and issues they find. Management shares stakeholders’ updates. It’s all interconnected, and the meetings are where the information is shared. As a software engineer, you are responsible for some part of this information sharing, so it would be irresponsible to hinder it. You might not like it, but the information must be shared for the system to remain efficient.</mark></p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="backlinks"><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class="overflow"><li><a href="../../notes/20230114200605" class="internal">Bitter Lessons in X Engineering</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer class><hr/><p>Created with <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">Quartz v4.2.3</a> © 2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://codeberg.org/Chenghao2023/blog">CodeBerg</a></li><li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></li></ul></footer></div></body><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.9/contrib/copy-tex.min.js" type="application/javascript"></script><script type="application/javascript">function c(){let t=this.parentElement;t.classList.toggle("is-collapsed");let l=t.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?this.scrollHeight:t.scrollHeight;t.style.maxHeight=l+"px";let o=t,e=t.parentElement;for(;e;){if(!e.classList.contains("callout"))return;let n=e.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?e.scrollHeight:e.scrollHeight+o.scrollHeight;e.style.maxHeight=n+"px",o=e,e=e.parentElement}}function i(){let t=document.getElementsByClassName("callout is-collapsible");for(let s of t){let l=s.firstElementChild;if(l){l.addEventListener("click",c),window.addCleanup(()=>l.removeEventListener("click",c));let e=s.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?l.scrollHeight:s.scrollHeight;s.style.maxHeight=e+"px"}}}document.addEventListener("nav",i);window.addEventListener("resize",i);
