<p id="ae558ce6">Choosing can be terrifying because it means we are accountable for our decisions, and there are infinite options before us. It is also frightening because once we have made a decision, we must live with it, it is the death of optionality. But I believe that choosing is the only way to live authentically. <a href="https://omnivore.app/me/https-jxnl-co-writing-2024-06-01-advice-to-young-people-18ee0870ae7#ae558ce6-0c74-477e-bf90-c354318e4bfb" class="external">⤴️<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a>  </p>

While successful people may attribute their success to their struggles, I believe a significant part of it is simply coming to terms with those struggles. Each person’s pain is maximum to them.
