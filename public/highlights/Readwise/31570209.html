</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing hard things, particularly things that involve learning something new, stretches your self-conception. It gives you confidence that you might be able to do things that you couldn’t do before</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What matters is the intensity, initiative, and commitment to effective learning, not the particulars of your timetable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But even the failure mode of ultralearning is usually that you will learn a skill fairly well</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Metalearning: First Draw a Map. Start by learning how to learn the subject or skill you want to tackle. Discover how to do good research and how to draw on your past competencies to learn new skills more easily.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus: Sharpen Your Knife. Cultivate the ability to concentrate. Carve out chunks of time when you can focus on learning, and make it easy to just do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Directness: Go Straight Ahead. Learn by doing the thing you want to become good at. Don’t trade it off for other tasks, just because those are more convenient or comfortable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Drill: Attack Your Weakest Point. Be ruthless in improving your weakest points. Break down complex skills into small parts; then master those parts and build them back together again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Retrieval: Test to Learn. Testing isn’t simply a way of assessing knowledge but a way of creating it. Test yourself before you feel confident, and push yourself to actively recall information rather than passively review it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feedback: Don’t Dodge the Punches. Feedback is harsh and uncomfortable. Know how to use it without letting your ego get in the way. Extract the signal from the noise, so you know what to pay attention to and what to ignore.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Retention: Don’t Fill a Leaky Bucket. Understand what you forget and why. Learn to remember things not just for now but forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Intuition: Dig Deep Before Building Up. Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills. Understand how understanding works, and don’t recourse to cheap tricks of memorization to avoid deeply knowing things.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Experimentation: Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone. All of these principles are only starting points. True mastery comes not just from following the path trodden by others but from exploring possibilities they haven’t yet imagined.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s one of taking responsibility for your own learning: deciding what you want to learn, how you want to learn it, and crafting your own plan to learn what you need to. You’re the one in charge, and you’re the one who’s ultimately responsible for the results you generate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An hour spent searching online for almost any skill should turn up courses, articles, and recommendations for how to learn it. Investing the time here can have incredible benefits because the quality of the materials you use can create orders-of-magnitude differences in your effectiveness. Even if you’re eager to start learning right away, investing a few hours now can save you dozens or hundreds later on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, research can also be a way of procrastinating, particularly if the method of learning is uncomfortable. Just doing a bit more research then becomes a strategy to avoid doing the work of learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A good rule of thumb is that you should invest approximately 10 percent of your total expected learning time into research prior to starting. If</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The struggles with focus that people have generally come in three broad varieties: starting, sustaining, and optimizing the quality of one’s focus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Recognizing that you’re procrastinating is the first step to avoiding it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, a good first crutch is to convince yourself to get over just the few minutes of maximal unpleasantness before you take a break. Telling yourself that you need to spend only five minutes on the task before you can stop and do something else is often enough to get you started</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your goal is to enhance your learning, and this often involves pushing through some sessions that are more frustrating than what could be considered ideal for flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Complex tasks may benefit from lower arousal, so working in a quiet room at home might be the right idea for math problems. Simpler tasks might benefit from a noisier environment, say working at a coffee shop.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Directness is the idea of learning being tied closely to the situation or context you want to use it in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to speak a language but try to learn mostly by playing on fun apps, rather than conversing with actual people. We want to work on collaborative, professional programs but mostly code scripts in isolation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>directly learning the thing we want feels too uncomfortable, boring, or frustrating, so we settle for some book, lecture, or app, hoping it will eventually make us better at the real thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many popular “brain-training” games also subscribe to this view of the mind, assuming that deep training on one set of cognitive tasks will extend to everyday reasoning. It’s been more than one hundred years since the verdict came in, yet the allure of a general transfer procedure still has many searching for the Holy Grail.</p>
