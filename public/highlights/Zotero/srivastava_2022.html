<p>Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and new qualitative capabilities with increasing scale. Despite their potentially transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 442 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI’s GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit “breakthrough” behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.</p>

<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Without proper care, they may also embed undesirable social bias deep into technology stacks and decision-making processes—but with proper care, they may enable decision-making to be automated with less human bias.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=4" class="external">(p. 4)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#ff7f7f;">Because they are narrowly targeted, and because their targets are often ones that language models are already known to perform, they are ill-suited to identify new and unexpected capabilities that language models may develop with increased scale, or to characterize the breadth of current capabilities.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=5" class="external">(p. 5)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Benchmark tasks are primarily intended to evaluate pre-trained models, without task-specific finetuning. By focusing on such tasks in the zeroand few-shot evaluation setting, it becomes possible to provide meaningful scores for even those tasks with a very small number of examples.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=7" class="external">(p. 7)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">For many critical use cases, it is important not just that models are accurate, but also that they do not assign high confidence to wrong answers.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=11" class="external">(p. 11)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Since a model’s multiple-choice selection is based on the conditional log likelihood scores of the target choices, normalized (top-1) probability can be treated as model confidence for tasks where there is one correct choice. Using this confidence score, we compute Brier score (Brier, 1950) and expected calibration error (ECE, Naeini et al., 2015) for each model size. While Brier score is a proper scoring rule for measuring the accuracy of predicted probabilities, ECE has been widely used to measure calibration due to its intuitive nature.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=11" class="external">(p. 11)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Language models make poorly calibrated predictions, but calibration improves as the models are made larger.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=11" class="external">(p. 11)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">The list of tasks with highest linearity contains tasks that are knowledge-based, that is, tasks that rely mostly on memorization of information that exists in training data, such as answering trivia-style questions in qa_wikidata, or performing simple text mappings as in linguistic_mappings and mult_data_wrangling.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=13" class="external">(p. 13)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Tasks that see strong breakthrough behavior include those that are composite in nature, meaning that they require a model to apply several distinct skills or perform multiple discrete steps in order to come up with the correct answer.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=13" class="external">(p. 13)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fffff;">Log probability of targets often improves smoothly across scales.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=14" class="external">(p. 14)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Breakthrough behavior is consistent with the model suddenly gaining new skills in an abrupt way. Careful analysis of task behavior, however, suggests that the underlying change in model capabilities is generally more smooth. T</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=14" class="external">(p. 14)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Using smoother metrics. The exact_str_match metric can lead to apparent sudden breakthroughs because of its inherent all-or-nothing discontinuity. It only gives credit for a model output that exactly matches the target string. Examining other metrics, such as BLEU, BLEURT, or ROUGE, can reveal more gradual progress.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=14" class="external">(p. 14)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Usually, no single metric can quantify task-solving ability, and it is always important to check model outputs to make sure that a metric is measuring what it is supposed to. This is especially important in the few-shot setting where the evaluation metrics are not explicitly targeted during training.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=15" class="external">(p. 15)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">The default formatting allows the model to compare the choices before scoring each one, which we naively think should improve performance. Instead, we find that including the choices hurts performance, even in a few-shot context.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=16" class="external">(p. 16)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Arguably, the first version of this task is closest to the original training objective: the model is simply asked to predict which natural language sentence is more likely, from which we infer the cause. We speculate that models perform poorly on the other versions because those tasks are dissimilar from their training distribution. Recent results on large language models suggest that this brittleness to question phrasing may improve with further increases in scale</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=17" class="external">(p. 17)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">This sensitivity to multiple choice presentation and cause_and_effect formulation demonstrate that the ability of a model to solve one version of a task does not necessarily carry over to other versions, even when humans would think of the versions as similar.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=17" class="external">(p. 17)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fffff;">• Bias often increases with scale in settings with broad or ambiguous context. • Bias can decrease with scale in settings with narrow, unambiguous context. • Bias can potentially be steered through appropriately chosen prompting.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=17" class="external">(p. 17)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Our results suggest that breakthrough performance can also occur on tasks that involve multistep reasoning. One possible explanation for the breakthrough phenomenon on multistep tasks is that the probability of success on the task scales like the product of the success probabilities on each step. If the probabilities of each of k steps increase linearly, their product will increase like a kth-order polynomial, which will be nearly flat until a sudden increase.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=25" class="external">(p. 25)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">A related striking observation is that the capabilities of models are often highly sensitive to details in the way a task is framed.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=25" class="external">(p. 25)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">Interestingly, PaLM does not show the same brittleness on cause_and_effect, suggesting that models may become less brittle as their size is further increased and datasets are improved.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=25" class="external">(p. 25)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
<p><mark style="background:#7fff7f;">A worrying finding is that model performance on social bias metrics often grows worse with increasing scale (Figure 12). One potential explanation for this may be that larger models do a better job of matching biases in their training set. This result emphasizes the importance of research, engineering, and policy efforts directed at fairness in machine-learning systems, especially at scale.</mark> <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LSM7IBSC?page=25" class="external">(p. 25)<span class="external-icon">⤴</span></a></p>
